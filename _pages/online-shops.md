## How to Buy Craft Supplies Online: A Practical Guide

1. **Compare Prices Across Sites**  
   Don't assume Amazon is the cheapest, often, it's more expensive than buying direct from a brand or a Canadian retailer. Check prices on Amazon, Temu, and the official store. Sometimes Temu matches or beats Amazon, but sometimes the price is the same.

2. **Buy Direct When Possible**  
   Many brands sell directly on their own websites or through Canadian craft supply shops. Buying direct can mean better prices, fresher stock, and more support for local businesses.

3. **Check for Loyalty Programs & Coupons**  
   Michaels, for example, almost always has a sale or coupon. They use doorcrasher deals to bring people in, so check their site or app for the latest offers. Sign up for loyalty programs at your favourite stores for extra savings.

4. **Watch for Shipping Costs**  
   Free shipping thresholds vary. Sometimes a slightly higher price with free shipping is a better deal than a lower price with high shipping fees.

5. **Read Reviews & Return Policies**  
   Check what other crafters say about the product and the store. Make sure you understand the return policy, especially for specialty or clearance items.

6. **Consider Bulk or Group Buys**  
   Some sites offer discounts for buying in bulk or as part of a co-op. This is great for clubs, classrooms, or splitting with friends.

7. **Sign Up for Newsletters**  
   Many stores send exclusive deals to their email subscribers. Consider a separate email for deals if you shop often.

8. **Be Wary of Too-Good-To-Be-True Prices**  
   If a deal looks suspiciously cheap, check the seller's reputation and reviews. Stick to well-known platforms or recommended stores.
