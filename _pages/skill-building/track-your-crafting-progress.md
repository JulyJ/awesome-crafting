## Why Tracking Helps You Improve Faster

Your brain forgets what your journal remembers.  
**Logging your craft practice turns random creativity into measurable growth.**

Whether you're painting miniatures, sewing garments, crafting stickers, or working with vinyl, keeping track of what you make, and how you made it, can:

- Build consistency
- Reveal patterns in your creative process
- Make improvement visible
- Help you troubleshoot more easily
- Boost motivation on slow days

## What to Track (and Why)

| Tracker Type | What It Logs | Benefit |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Project Log** | Start/end dates, materials, techniques, outcome | Track what you’ve completed and learned |
| **Skill Practice Sheet** | Repetitions, progress, confidence level | Focused growth in specific skills (e.g. weeding vinyl, fine brush control) |
| **Material Test Page** | Swatches, colour reactions, glue tests | Build a personal database for future reference |
| **Inspiration Notes** | Ideas, prompts, themes, references | Capture sparks before they fade |
| **Mistake Journal** | What went wrong and why | Prevent repeat errors and learn faster |

## How Often Should You Log?

| Your Style | Logging Frequency | Tip |
|------------|-------------------|-----|

## Progress Without Pressure

Tracking is about **curiosity**, not judgment.  
You're not logging to prove you’re “productive”, you're tracking to understand:

- What you enjoy  
- What frustrates you  
- What methods get the best results

Even a quick 1-sentence log like  
> “Tried glossy sealant on MDF, cracked a bit. Needs primer first.”  
…can save you hours later.

## Creative Progress Journal Prompts

- What did I learn today?
- What would I do differently next time?

- How did the material behave?
- Which technique felt awkward or effortless?

## Final Thought

Tracking your crafting isn't about numbers, it's about **noticing**.  
It’s how you turn scattered sessions into a skill arc.  
It’s how you turn mistakes into **mastery**.
