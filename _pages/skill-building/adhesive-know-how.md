## Why Adhesive Knowledge Matters

Glue may seem simple, but the wrong choice can mean peeled edges, warped materials, or sticky disasters. Different crafts require different bonding strengths, flexibility, drying times, and finishes.

**Knowing which adhesive to use, and how to apply it, can make the difference between a project that lasts and one that falls apart.**

---

### ðŸ§µ **Fabric Glue**  

- **Best For:** Seamless repair, hem fixes  
- **Strength:** Medium (washable)  
- **Drying Time:** 30 min to 6 hrs  
- **Pros:** Flexible, soft finish  
- **Cons:** Can bleed through thin fabrics  

> _Test on scrap before using on final fabric_

---

### ðŸ§² **Contact Cement**  

- **Best For:** Leather, rubber, foam  
- **Strength:** Very high  
- **Drying Time:** 10â€“30 minutes (before joining)

## Choosing Glue Based on Your Project Goals

| Project Type | Adhesive Goals | Best Choices |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Quick Repair** | Fast-drying, strong | Super glue, hot glue |
| **Detail Work** | Precise, clear finish | CA glue, micro-tip applicators |
| **Long-Term Durability** | Strong, flexible | Epoxy, wood glue, contact cement |
| **No Warping or Bleed** | Dry clear, minimal moisture | Glue stick, tape runners |
| **Washable Finish** | Flexible bond | Fabric glue, fusible products |

---

## Clean Application Tips

- **Less is more:** Thin layers bond better than globs.
- **Spread evenly:** Use brushes, fingers, or spatulas.
- **Dry fully:** Donâ€™t rush assembly, let it cure.
- **Clamp if needed:** Use clips, weights, or elastic bands.
- **Test on scrap first:** Avoid surprises on your main project.

> ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Keep cotton swabs, baby wipes, and a silicone mat nearby when working with glue. Theyâ€™re lifesavers for spills and smudges.
