## Why Practice Exercises Matter

Practicing isn't just for beginners. Every great crafter, from hobbyists to pros, benefits from routine skill workouts. Purposeful repetition builds muscle memory, sharpens technique, and prevents costly errors. These exercises can be tailored to any craft, whether you're wielding a paintbrush, rotary cutter, or soldering iron.

> **Think of them as warmups for your creativity.**  
They don't have to result in a finished piece. The goal is skill reinforcement.

## Progress Tracking Template

Create a DIY tracker in your sketchbook or journal:

|------|----------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| June 29 | Square cutting | Precision | 15 mins | 2 mm deviation reduced |
| June 30 | Sewing lines | Control | 20 mins | Zigzag better, curved shaky |

Keep your tracker visible, it’s a quiet motivator.
