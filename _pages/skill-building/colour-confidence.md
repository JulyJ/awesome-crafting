## Why Colour Confidence Matters

colour is one of the most powerful design tools in your creative toolbox. The **right palette** can create emotion, balance, and visual impact. The wrong one? It can feel chaotic, dull, or simply “off.”

Whether you're choosing paper for a card, vinyl for a sign, or paint for a dollhouse, **building beautiful, intentional colour palettes** will instantly elevate your work.

## The Building Blocks of colour

| Term | Definition | Crafting Relevance |
|------|------------|--------------------|
| **Hue** | The basic colour (red, blue, green…) | Starting point of any palette |
| **Value** | Lightness or darkness | High contrast = bold, low contrast = soft |
| **Saturation** | Intensity or purity | Bright colours pop, muted feel cozy or vintage |
| **Temperature** | Warm (reds, yellows) vs cool (blues, greens) | Sets mood and visual balance |

> 🎨 **Tip:** Use a colour wheel tool (physical or digital) to help visualize relationships between colours.

## 5 Foolproof colour Harmony Types

| Harmony Type | Description | Mood/Effect | Example colours |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Monochromatic** | One hue, many tints/shades | Elegant, minimal | Light pink, blush, rose |
| **Analogous** | colours next to each other | Calm, cohesive | Blue, teal, green |
| **Complementary** | Opposite on colour wheel | Bold, high contrast | Red & green, blue & orange |
| **Split-Complementary** | One hue + 2 neighbors of its opposite | Balanced, lively | Violet + yellow-orange & yellow-green |
| **Triadic** | 3 colours evenly spaced | Vibrant, dynamic | Red, yellow, blue |

## How to Build a colour Palette (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Choose a Base colour**

Pick a hue that reflects the feeling or theme you want.  

- Warm colours = energy, excitement  
- Cool colours = calm, serenity  
- Neutrals = elegance, flexibility

### 2. **Select a Harmony Style**

Use the harmony types above to guide your colour pairings. Decide:

- Do you want contrast?
- Do you want softness?
- Do you want lots of variety?

### 3. **Balance with Neutrals**

Neutrals help your colours pop. Add:

- White for lightness
- Black or deep gray for drama
- Tan or beige for warmth

### 4. **Limit Your Palette**

Stick to 3–5 main colours. Too many can look messy. A balanced palette might look like:

- 1 dominant
- 1 accent
- 2 neutrals
- 1 metallic or texture colour (optional)
