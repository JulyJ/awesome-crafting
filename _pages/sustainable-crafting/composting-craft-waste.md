## Why Compost Craft Waste?

| Benefit | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reduces Landfill Waste** | Diverts organic materials from landfills, where they produce methane. |
| **Creates Nutrient-Rich Soil** | Produces a valuable soil amendment for gardens and plants. |
| **Reduces Carbon Footprint** | Less waste sent to landfills means fewer greenhouse gas emissions. |

## Compostable Craft Materials

| Material Type | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Natural Fibers** | Cotton, wool, linen, silk (undyed/natural dyes) | Cut into small pieces to speed decomposition. Avoid synthetic blends. |
| **Paper & Cardboard** | Paper scraps, cardboard tubes, egg cartons (uncoated) | Shred or tear into small pieces. Avoid glossy or heavily inked paper. |
| **Wood & Plant Matter** | Sawdust (untreated wood), wood shavings, dried flowers, leaves | Ensure wood is untreated and free of glues/finishes. |
| **Food Scraps** | Fruit and vegetable peels, coffee grounds, tea bags | Standard kitchen compostables. |

## Non-Compostable Craft Materials (Avoid)

| Material Type | Examples | Reason to Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| **Synthetic Fibers** | Polyester, acrylic, nylon | Do not break down, release microplastics. |
| **Treated Wood** | Plywood, MDF, painted wood | Contains glues, resins, or chemicals. |
| **Glitter & Plastics** | All types of glitter, plastic beads, plastic packaging | Non-biodegradable, harmful to environment. |
| **Metals** | Wire, metal findings | Do not decompose, can contaminate compost. |
| **Heavily Glued/Inked Paper** | Glossy paper, heavily printed paper | Chemicals can harm compost. |

## Setting Up Your Composting System

| **Compost Bin (Outdoor)** | Large capacity, good for garden waste. | Requires outdoor space, can attract pests if not managed. | Gardeners, those with larger volumes of organic waste. |
| **Vermicomposting (Worm Bin)** | Odorless, can be done indoors, produces worm castings. | Requires managing worms, smaller capacity. | Apartment dwellers, those wanting nutrient-rich fertilizer. |
| **Bokashi Composting** | Ferments food scraps, can compost meat/dairy. | Requires special bran, needs a secondary burial/compost. | Those with limited space, wanting to compost all food waste. |
