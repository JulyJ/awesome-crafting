## Why Water Conservation Matters in Crafting

| Reason | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Environmental Impact** | Reduces strain on local water resources and energy used for water treatment. |
| **Cost Savings** | Lower water bills for your home or studio. |
| **Resource Scarcity** | Contributes to responsible use of a finite resource. |

## Water-Saving Practices by Craft Type

| Craft Type | Water-Saving Tip |
|---|---|
| **Painting (Acrylics, Watercolors)** | Use multiple water jars (one for initial rinse, one for cleaner rinse). Use a spray bottle to keep paints wet instead of constantly rinsing brushes. |
| **Dyeing (Fabric, Yarn)** | Reuse dye baths for lighter shades. Use low-water immersion dyeing techniques. Batch dye larger quantities at once. |
| **Pottery/Ceramics** | Reuse clay water for wedging or reclaiming clay. Use a two-bucket system for cleaning tools and hands. |
| **Printmaking** | Use a spray bottle for dampening paper instead of soaking. Reuse water from cleaning plates/screens for initial rinses. |
| **General Studio Cleaning** | Use a dry brush or vacuum to remove dust and debris before wiping with a damp cloth. Use a bucket for washing tools instead of running water. |

## Smart Water Management in Your Studio

| Practice | Description |
|---|---|
| **Two-Bucket System** | Have one bucket for initial dirty rinses and another for cleaner rinses. This extends the life of your clean water. |
| **Water Recycling** | Collect rinse water (if non-toxic) for watering plants or for initial washes of tools. |
| **Mindful Rinsing** | Only rinse tools when necessary. Wipe off excess paint/clay before rinsing. |
| **Fix Leaks** | Repair any dripping faucets or leaky hoses immediately. |
| **Efficient Cleaning** | Clean multiple tools at once rather than individually under running water. |
