## What is Candle Making?

Candle making is the art and craft of creating candles from various wax materials, wicks, and additives. This ancient practice has evolved from a necessity for lighting into a popular hobby and commercial enterprise. Modern candle making combines traditional techniques with contemporary materials, offering crafters endless possibilities for creativity.

The basic process involves melting wax, adding fragrance and colour if desired, securing a wick in a container or mold, and pouring the liquid wax to cool and solidify. The key to successful candle making lies in understanding your materials and how they interact with each other.

## Types of Candle Wax

### Paraffin Wax

The most common and economical choice for beginners, paraffin wax is a petroleum-based product that offers excellent scent throw and vibrant colour acceptance.

### Soy Wax

A natural, renewable alternative made from soybean oil. Soy wax burns cleaner and longer than paraffin, making it popular for container candles.

### Beeswax

A natural wax produced by honey bees, prized for its sweet honey scent and natural golden colour. It burns the longest and cleanest of all waxes.

### Coconut Wax

A premium natural wax made from coconut oil, known for excellent fragrance throw and clean burning properties.

### Palm Wax

Derived from palm oil, this natural wax creates unique crystalline patterns and is excellent for pillar candles.
