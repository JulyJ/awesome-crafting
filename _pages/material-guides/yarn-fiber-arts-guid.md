## What is Yarn?

Yarn is a continuous strand of twisted or spun fibers used for knitting, crocheting, weaving, and other textile arts. Created by spinning natural or synthetic fibers together, yarn comes in countless varieties of weight, texture, colour, and composition. The choice of yarn fundamentally affects the appearance, feel, durability, and care requirements of your finished project, making yarn selection one of the most important decisions in fiber arts.
