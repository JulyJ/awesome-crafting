## What is Soap Making?

Soap making is the process of creating soap through saponification - a chemical reaction between fats or oils and an alkali (lye). This ancient craft has evolved into both an art form and practical skill, allowing crafters to create custom soaps with specific properties, scents, and appearances.

There are several methods of soap making, from beginner-friendly melt and pour to advanced cold process and hot process techniques. Each method offers different levels of customization and requires varying degrees of safety precautions and equipment.

## Soap Making Methods

### Cold Process (CP)

The most popular method for experienced soap makers, involving mixing oils with lye solution at room temperature. Offers complete control over ingredients and properties.

### Hot Process (HP)

Similar to cold process but uses heat to accelerate saponification. Results in rustic-looking bars that are ready to use immediately.

### Melt and Pour (MP)

Beginner-friendly method using pre-made soap base. Simply melt, add colours and fragrances, then pour into molds.

### Rebatching

Grating and remelting existing soap to create new bars. Good for fixing failed batches or using soap scraps.
