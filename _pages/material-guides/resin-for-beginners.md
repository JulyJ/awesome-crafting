## What is Craft Resin?

Craft resin is a liquid polymer that hardens into a clear, durable, glass-like finish when cured. It's used to create jewelry, coasters, art pieces, and protective coatings. The material starts as a viscous liquid and transforms into a solid through chemical reactions (epoxy) or UV light exposure (UV resin).
