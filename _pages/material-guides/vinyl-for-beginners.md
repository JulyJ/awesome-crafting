## What is Craft Vinyl?

Craft vinyl is a thin, flexible material with an adhesive backing used for decorating surfaces, creating custom designs, and personalizing items. It comes in two main categories: adhesive vinyl (applied cold) and heat transfer vinyl (applied with heat). Understanding these differences is crucial for successful projects.
