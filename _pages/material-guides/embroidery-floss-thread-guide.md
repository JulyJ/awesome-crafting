## What is Embroidery Floss?

Embroidery floss is a loosely twisted thread composed of multiple strands (typically 6) that can be separated and used individually or in combination depending on your project needs. Unlike regular sewing thread, embroidery floss is specifically designed for decorative stitching, offering superior colour retention, sheen, and texture variety. The ability to separate strands makes it incredibly versatile for creating different thread weights and coverage levels in your embroidery work.

## Types of Embroidery Thread

### Cotton Embroidery Floss

The most popular and widely available embroidery thread, cotton floss offers excellent colour variety, affordability, and ease of use. It's made from mercerized cotton, which gives it a subtle sheen and prevents shrinkage.

**Properties:**

- 6-strand divisible construction
- Colourfast and washable
- Matte to slight sheen finish
- Excellent colour saturation
- Easy to work with for beginners

**Best Uses:** Cross-stitch, traditional embroidery, samplers, everyday projects

### Silk Embroidery Thread

Premium natural fiber thread known for its lustrous sheen and smooth texture. Silk thread is stronger than cotton and creates beautiful, professional-looking results.

**Properties:**

- High natural sheen and luster
- Smooth, slippery texture
- Strong and durable
- Excellent colour depth
- More expensive than cotton

**Best Uses:** Fine embroidery, heirloom pieces, silk ribbon embroidery, luxury projects

### Rayon Embroidery Thread

Synthetic thread that mimics silk's lustrous appearance at a more affordable price point. Rayon offers brilliant colours and high sheen.

**Properties:**

- Very high sheen and brilliance
- Vibrant colour options
- Less durable than natural fibers
- Can be more challenging to work with
- Heat-sensitive

**Best Uses:** Decorative embroidery, machine embroidery, contemporary projects

### Metallic Embroidery Thread

Specialty threads incorporating metallic fibers for sparkle and shine. Available in gold, silver, and various metallic colours.

**Properties:**

- Reflective, sparkly appearance
- Can be fragile and prone to fraying
- Requires special handling techniques
- Limited colour range
- More expensive than standard threads

**Best Uses:** Accent work, holiday projects, special occasion pieces, mixed-media embroidery

### Linen Embroidery Thread

Natural fiber thread with a rustic, organic appearance. Linen thread is strong and creates beautiful texture in finished work.

**Properties:**

- Natural, organic appearance
- Strong and durable
- Slight texture and irregularity
- Limited colour selection
- Excellent for historical reproductions

**Best Uses:** Traditional embroidery, historical reproductions, rustic projects

## Thread Weight and Ply

### Understanding Thread Weight

Thread weight refers to the thickness of the thread. Lower numbers indicate heavier (thicker) threads, while higher numbers indicate finer threads.

**Common Weights:**

- **Weight 12-16:** Heavy threads for bold, prominent stitching
- **Weight 25-30:** Medium weight for general embroidery
- **Weight 40-50:** Fine threads for delicate detail work
- **Weight 60-80:** Very fine threads for intricate work

### Ply Construction

Ply refers to the number of individual strands twisted together to create the thread.

**Single Ply:** One continuous strand, smooth and even
**Multi-Ply:** Multiple strands twisted together, can be separated for different effects

## Choosing the Right Thread

### Consider Your Fabric

- **Heavy fabrics:** Use heavier threads (lower weight numbers)
- **Delicate fabrics:** Use finer threads (higher weight numbers)
- **Loose weaves:** Choose threads that won't pull through easily
- **Tight weaves:** Finer threads work better for precise stitching

### Consider Your Technique

- **Cross-stitch:** 6-strand cotton floss, typically using 2-3 strands
- **Surface embroidery:** Varies by design, 1-6 strands depending on coverage
- **Blackwork:** Single strand for fine line work
- **Crewel work:** Wool threads or multiple strands of cotton

### Consider Your Project

- **Washable items:** Cotton or synthetic threads
- **Display pieces:** Silk or rayon for maximum visual impact
- **Children's items:** Durable cotton threads
- **Heirloom pieces:** High-quality silk or cotton

- Label storage with colour numbers for easy identification

## Working with Embroidery Floss

### Preparation

1. **Cutting:** Cut 18-24 inch lengths to prevent tangling
2. **Separating:** Gently separate strands as needed
3. **Conditioning:** Some threads benefit from running through Thread Heaven or similar conditioners

### Threading Techniques

- Use a needle appropriate for your thread weight
- Don't double-knot; use a waste knot or away knot instead
- Keep thread tension consistent for even stitches

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tangling:** Use shorter lengths, separate strands carefully
- **Fraying:** Condition thread, use appropriate needle size
- **Uneven stitches:** Maintain consistent tension, check thread direction

## Care and Maintenance

### Washing Embroidered Items

- Test colourfast properties before washing
- Use cool water and gentle detergent
- Air dry away from direct sunlight
- Iron on reverse side if needed

### Long-term Storage

- Clean thoroughly before storage
- Store flat or rolled, never folded
- Use acid-free tissue paper for valuable pieces
- Keep in a cool, dry environment

## Advanced Techniques

### Colour Blending

Combine different coloured strands in your needle to create subtle colour variations and custom shades.

### Texture Effects

- **Vary strand count:** Use different numbers of strands for textural interest
- **Mix fiber types:** Combine cotton and silk for unique effects
- **Directional stitching:** Change stitch direction for light reflection variations

### Specialty Applications

- **Stumpwork:** Use silk threads for dimensional embroidery
