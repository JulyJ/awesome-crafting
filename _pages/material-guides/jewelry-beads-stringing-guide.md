## What are Jewelry Beads?

Jewelry beads are decorative elements with holes for stringing, available in countless materials, shapes, sizes, and finishes. They serve as the primary building blocks for necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other beaded jewelry. Understanding bead properties, sizing systems, and compatibility with stringing materials is essential for creating durable, beautiful jewelry.

The art of beadwork spans cultures and centuries, with modern jewelry makers having access to both traditional materials like glass and stone, as well as innovative synthetic options that offer unique properties and design possibilities.
