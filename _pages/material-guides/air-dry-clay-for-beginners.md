## What is Air-Dry Clay?

Air-dry clay is a water-based modeling material that hardens naturally through evaporation without requiring kiln firing or oven baking. Air-dry clay is one of the earliest artisan supplies in human civilization, consisting of natural clay minerals mixed with binding agents and water. Modern formulations include paper fibers, cellulose, or synthetic polymers to improve workability and reduce cracking.
