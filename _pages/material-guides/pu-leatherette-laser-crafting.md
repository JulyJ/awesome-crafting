## What is PU Leatherette?

PU (Polyurethane) leatherette is a synthetic leather alternative made from a fabric base coated with polyurethane. It offers the look and feel of genuine leather while being vegan-friendly, more affordable, and remarkably consistent for laser cutting and engraving. Unlike PVC-based faux leather (which releases toxic fumes when lasered), PU leatherette is safe for laser applications.

### Why PU Leatherette is Perfect for Laser Crafters

| Advantage | Compared to Genuine Leather | Compared to PVC Faux Leather | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| **Laser Safe** | Equal | PVC releases toxic chlorine gas | Safe for home studios |
| **Consistency** | More consistent (no natural variations) | Similar | Predictable results every time |
| **Cost** | 70-85% cheaper | Similar | Affordable experimentation |
| **Color Variety** | Much wider selection | Similar | Creative freedom |
| **Availability** | More accessible | Similar | Easy to source |
| **Engraving Contrast** | Excellent | Excellent | Beautiful results |
| **Edge Quality** | Slightly better (no fraying) | Similar | Clean professional edges |
| **Environmental** | Vegan, no animal products | PU better than PVC | Ethical choice |

### Types of PU Leatherette

| Type | Thickness | Backing | Best For | Laser Compatibility | Price Range |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Standard PU** | 0.6-1.0mm | Fabric knit | Earrings, patches, bookmarks | Excellent | $8-15/yard |
| **Glitter PU** | 0.8-1.2mm | Fabric knit | Statement jewelry, accessories | Very Good | $12-20/yard |

## Laser Cutting PU Leatherette

### Optimal Laser Settings

| Machine Power | Speed (mm/s) | Power (%) | Passes | Air Assist | Result |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| **40W CO2** | 300-500 | 40-60% | 1 | Recommended | Clean cut, minimal charring |
| **50W CO2** | 350-600 | 35-55% | 1 | Recommended | Fast, clean cuts |
| **60W+ CO2** | 400-700 | 30-50% | 1 | Essential | Very fast, watch for burning |
| **Diode (20W+)** | 100-300 | 80-100% | 2-3 | If available | Possible but slower |

**Important Notes:**
- Always test on scrap first - PU varies by brand and thickness
- Air assist prevents flame and reduces smoke staining
- Lower power + higher speed = less edge darkening
- Cutting is easier than engraving with PU

### Cutting Techniques & Tips

| Technique | Purpose | How To | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Single Pass Cutting** | Standard cutting | Optimize power/speed balance | Clean edges, minimal char |
| **Masking Tape Application** | Prevent smoke marks | Apply to both sides before cutting | Pristine surface |
| **Honeycomb Bed** | Support during cutting | Use proper bed or add cardstock underneath | No back marks |
| **Vector Path Optimization** | Reduce cutting time | Nest parts efficiently, minimize travel | Faster, cheaper |
| **Test Matrix** | Find perfect settings | Cut grid with varying power/speed | Documented settings |

### Common Cutting Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution | Prevention |
|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Not Cutting Through** | Low power, too fast | Increase power or slow speed | Test cuts first |
| **Excessive Charring** | Too much power, too slow | Decrease power, increase speed | Start conservative |
| **Melted Edges** | Too slow, excessive heat | Increase speed | Quick passes better |
| **Smoke Staining** | Poor ventilation, no masking | Use masking tape, increase airflow | Always mask light colors |
| **Warping/Curling** | Uneven heat | Support material flat, use weights | Proper material prep |
| **Incomplete Corners** | Speed too high for direction changes | Slow overall speed slightly | Adjust for complexity |

## Laser Engraving PU Leatherette

### Engraving Settings for Different Effects

| Desired Effect | Power | Speed | DPI | Passes | Result |
|----------------|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| **Light Etching** | 20-35% | 400-600mm/s | 300 | 1 | Subtle, delicate marks |
| **Medium Depth** | 35-50% | 300-500mm/s | 300-400 | 1 | Standard engraving |
| **Deep Engraving** | 45-65% | 250-400mm/s | 300-500 | 1-2 | Strong contrast, texture |
| **Photo Engraving** | 25-45% | 300-500mm/s | 400-600 | 1 | Photographic detail |
| **Texture Patterns** | 30-50% | 350-550mm/s | 200-300 | 1 | Raised pattern effect |

### What Happens When You Engrave PU

**Surface Layers:**
1. **Top PU Coating** - Laser removes this layer (dark brown/black exposed)
2. **Fabric Base** - Revealed after PU removal (provides contrast)
3. **Backing** - Should never reach this (too deep)

**Color Results:**
- Light colors (white, cream, pastels) → Dark brown/black engraving (excellent contrast)
- Dark colors (black, navy, burgundy) → Slightly lighter/brown engraving (subtle)
- Metallics → Base fabric color shows (varies by product)
- Glitter PU → Removes glitter layer, shows base (interesting texture)

### Engraving Design Considerations

| Design Type | Works Well? | Optimal Settings | Notes |
|-------------|------------|------------------|-------|
| **Text** | Excellent | Medium power, medium-high speed | 8pt+ for readability |
| **Simple Graphics** | Excellent | Medium power, medium speed | Bold designs best |
| **Photos** | Good | Lower power, image prep crucial | High contrast images work best |
| **Mandalas/Patterns** | Excellent | Medium power, medium-high speed | Intricate details possible |
| **Solid Fills** | Fair-Good | Lower power, slower speed | Can create texture variation |
| **Fine Lines** | Very Good | Lower power, faster speed | Minimum 0.5mm line width |

| **Clean Workspace** | Remove debris regularly | Residue buildup flammable | Fire risk |

### Heat Application Safety

| Hazard | Prevention | If Accident Occurs |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Burns** | Use heat-resistant gloves, caution | Cool water immediately |
| **Melting/Scorching** | Test temperature first | Discard piece, adjust settings |
| **Fume Inhalation** | Work in ventilated area | Move to fresh air |
| **Equipment Damage** | Follow manufacturer guidelines | Unplug, assess damage |
