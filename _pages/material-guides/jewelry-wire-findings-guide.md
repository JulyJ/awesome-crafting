## What are Jewelry Findings?

Jewelry findings are the functional and decorative components used to connect, finish, and enhance jewelry pieces. These essential hardware elements include clasps, jump rings, ear wires, head pins, and various connectors that transform raw materials into wearable art.

Understanding wire gauges and findings is crucial for creating professional-quality jewelry. The right combination of wire thickness, metal type, and findings ensures both durability and aesthetic appeal in your finished pieces.
