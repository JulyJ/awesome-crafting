## Understanding Paper for Crafting Success

Choosing the right paper transforms craft projects from amateur to professional. Paper weight, finish, fiber content, and purpose all determine whether your creation holds up, looks polished, or falls apart. This guide demystifies paper terminology and helps you select the perfect paper for every project.

## Paper Weight Explained

| Weight (lb) | Weight (gsm) | Thickness Feel | Common Uses | Can It Fold? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **20-24 lb** | 75-90 gsm | Thin, like copy paper | Origami, tissue overlays, pattern tracing | Excellent |
| **28-32 lb** | 105-120 gsm | Light, like magazine | Lightweight cards, liners, paper piecing | Very good |
| **65-80 lb** | 176-218 gsm | Medium, like cardstock | Card bases, scrapbook pages, die-cutting | Good with scoring |
| **80-100 lb** | 218-271 gsm | Heavy cardstock | Sturdy cards, boxes, structure | Requires scoring |
| **110-130 lb** | 298-350 gsm | Very heavy | Premium cards, covers, stands alone | Difficult, deep scoring needed |

**Note**: Paper weight systems differ. Text weight (20-80 lb) and cover weight (65-130 lb) measure different paper sizes, so 80 lb text ≠ 80 lb cover. GSM (grams per square meter) is universal and more reliable.

## Basic Paper Types

| **Scrapbooking** | Scrapbook paper, cardstock | 65-80 lb | Various, acid-free | Archival, decorative, photo-safe |
| **Origami** | Origami or copy paper | 20-24 lb | Smooth | Folds crisply, holds creases, affordable |
| **Die Cutting** | Cardstock | 65-100 lb | Matte | Clean cuts, sturdy results, versatile |
| **Stamping** | Smooth cardstock | 80-110 lb | Matte or satin | Crisp impressions, ink absorption |
| **Watercolor** | Watercolor paper | 140-300 lb | Cold or hot press | Wet media, no buckling, proper absorption |

| **Papercraft Models** | Cardstock | 65-110 lb | Matte | Holds shape, scores well, precise folds |

## Acid-Free and Archival Quality

| Paper Quality | pH Level | Longevity | Best For | Cost Difference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Acidic Paper** | Below pH 7 | 10-50 years, yellows, brittle | Temporary projects, practice | Standard |
| **Acid-Free** | pH 7 or above | 100+ years, stable | Scrapbooks, photos, keepsakes | +10-30% |
| **Archival Quality** | pH 7+, lignin-free, buffered | 200+ years, museum-quality | Important documents, fine art, preservation | +30-80% |

**When It Matters**: Always use acid-free paper for scrapbooks, photo storage, or anything meant to last. Acid migrates and can damage adjacent photos and papers over time.

## Paper Brightness and Whiteness

| Brightness Level | Appearance | Best For | Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **92-94** | Slightly off-white, natural | Everyday crafts, warm projects | Less eye strain, softer look |
| **95-97** | Bright white | Most crafts, vibrant colors | Standard, versatile |
| **98-100** | Ultra-bright white | Professional printing, photos | Colors pop, modern, crisp |
| **Natural/Cream** | Off-white, ivory, warm tone | Vintage, rustic, warm themes | Pairs well with earth tones |
| **True White** | Pure white, neutral | Modern, clean, any color scheme | Most versatile, professional |

## Grain Direction

| Grain | How to Test | Why It Matters | Best Practice |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Long Grain** | Paper folds smoother parallel to long edge | Cleaner folds, less cracking | Fold with the grain |
| **Short Grain** | Paper folds smoother parallel to short edge | Important for bookbinding, cards | Align grain with spine/fold |
| **Testing Method** | Gently bend (don't crease) both directions—easier direction = with grain | Affects folding, tearing, curling | Always test before cutting large quantities |

## Where to Buy Paper

| **Office Supply (Staples, Office Depot)** | Basic cardstock, copy paper | $ | Affordable, bulk options, local | Limited colors/textures |

**Key Tips**: Store paper flat or vertically (never bent), away from direct sunlight, in low humidity (30-50%), and away from acidic materials.

## Common Paper Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Curling** | Humidity changes, one-sided coating | Weight down, humidify/dehumidify room | Store properly, use heavier weight |
| **Tearing When Folding** | Paper too thick, folding against grain | Score before folding, fold with grain | Test grain direction first, use bone folder |
| **Ink Bleeding** | Paper too absorbent, wrong ink | Use thicker paper, different ink, seal paper | Test on scrap, use smooth cardstock |
| **Yellowing** | Acidic paper, UV exposure | Use acid-free paper, UV-protective storage | Buy archival quality, store properly |
| **Won't Feed Through Printer** | Too thick, wrong finish | Check printer specs, hand-feed, adjust settings | Know printer limits (usually 110 lb max) |
| **Dull Colors After Printing** | Wrong paper finish, ink type | Use glossy for photos, matte for graphics | Match paper to ink and project |

| **20-60 lb** | No | None, or bone folder for crisp edge | Fold and crease with bone folder |
| **65-80 lb** | Recommended | Bone folder, scoring board | Score first, fold along score line |
| **80-110 lb** | Yes | Scoring board, embossing tool | Deep score, fold carefully, burnish |
| **110 lb+** | Absolutely | Scoring tool, ruler, pressure | Multiple score passes, fold slowly, press firmly |

**Scoring Direction**: Always score on the **inside** of the fold (where the fold compresses) for clean results.

## Adhesives by Paper Type

| Paper Type | Best Adhesive | Avoid | Application Tips |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Thin (20-60 lb)** | Glue stick, spray adhesive, double-sided tape | Liquid glue (warps) | Apply sparingly, work quickly |
| **Cardstock (65-110 lb)** | Liquid glue, tape runner, foam adhesive | Hot glue (too bulky) | Use enough for hold, not excess |
| **Vellum/Translucent** | Vellum adhesive, mini dots, corners only | Standard glue (shows through) | Minimal, hide under embellishments |
| **Metallic/Glossy** | Tape runner, strong double-sided tape | Liquid glue (slides, doesn't stick) | Clean surface first, firm pressure |
| **Textured** | Liquid glue, strong tape | Weak adhesives (won't grip texture) | Press into texture, extra drying time |
| **Chipboard/Heavy** | Hot glue, strong liquid glue, brads | Glue stick (too weak) | Clamp or weight while drying |

## Testing New Paper

| Test | How to Perform | What It Reveals | Before Starting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Grain Direction** | Gently bend both directions without creasing | Folding direction, tear direction | Large projects, folded cards |
| **Ink Compatibility** | Print/stamp on scrap | Bleeding, drying time, color vibrancy | Printing, stamping projects |
| **Fold Test** | Score and fold a scrap piece | Cracking, clean fold, scoring needs | Cards, boxes, dimensional projects |
| **Adhesive Test** | Apply various adhesives to scrap | Which adhesive works best, show-through | Multi-material projects |
| **Color Fastness** | Expose sample to light for days | Fading susceptibility | Archival, displayed projects |
| **Eraser Test** | Erase pencil marks | Surface durability, texture retention | Projects with pencil marks, drawing |

## Budget-Friendly Paper Strategies

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Paper selection impacts every aspect of your craft: durability, appearance, functionality, and longevity. Start with understanding weight (GSM is most reliable), choose acid-free for anything archival, match finish to your project, and always test before committing to large quantities.

For most crafters, a starter collection should include:
- 80 lb cardstock in white and basic colors
- 65 lb patterned scrapbook paper
- Copy paper for templates and origami
- Vellum for overlays
- One specialty paper that excites you

Build your collection based on the crafts you love, buy quality for final projects and budget options for practice, and always store paper properly to maintain its quality. Paper is the foundation of paper crafts—invest in understanding it, and your projects will reflect that knowledge.
