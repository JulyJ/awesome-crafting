## Cast vs. Extruded Acrylic

| Property | Cast Acrylic | Extruded Acrylic |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Laser Engraving | Frosted, clean detail | Poor or unclear |
| Edge Finish | Slightly frosted | Clear/glossy |
| Melting Point | Higher | Lower |
| Thickness Tolerance | Slight variations | More consistent |
| Price | Higher | Lower |
| Manufacturing | Cell-cast in molds | Continuous extrusion |
| Stress Levels | Lower internal stress | Higher internal stress |
| Cracking Risk | Less prone to stress cracks | More prone to cracking |

## Laser Settings Comparison

| Material Type | Thickness | Cut Speed | Cut Power | Engrave Speed | Engrave Power |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Cast Clear | 1/8" (3mm) | 15-25 mm/s | 80-100% | 800-1200 mm/min | 20-30% |
| Cast Clear | 1/4" (6mm) | 8-15 mm/s | 90-100% | 600-1000 mm/min | 25-35% |
| Cast Clear | 1/2" (12mm) | 3-8 mm/s | 100% | 400-800 mm/min | 30-40% |
| Extruded Clear | 1/8" (3mm) | 20-30 mm/s | 70-90% | 1000-1500 mm/min | 15-25% |
| Cast Coloured | 1/8" (3mm) | 12-20 mm/s | 85-100% | 700-1000 mm/min | 25-35% |
| Fluorescent | 1/8" (3mm) | 10-18 mm/s | 90-100% | 600-900 mm/min | 30-40% |

*Note: Settings vary by laser power and brand. Always test on scraps first.*

## Acrylic Finish Options

| Finish | Description | Best Use | Laser Compatibility |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Clear | Transparent, glossy | Signs, panels | Excellent |
| Matte/Frosted | Diffuses light, soft look | LED edge lights, signage | Very Good |
| Glitter | Sparkling embedded effect | Jewelry, tags | Good (may chip) |
| Mirror | Reflective surface | Decor, name signs | Fair (coating may burn) |
| Fluorescent | Glows on edges | Accents, keychains | Good |
| Opaque | Solid colour, no light pass | Tags, layered art | Excellent |
| Textured | Surface patterns | Decorative panels | Variable |
| Two-tone | Colour gradient | Artistic projects | Good |

## Thickness Guide and Applications

| Thickness | Metric | Best Applications | Cutting Difficulty | Engraving Depth |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1/16" | 1.5mm | Thin overlays, templates | Easy | Shallow |
| 1/8" | 3mm | Signs, jewelry, small parts | Easy | Medium |
| 3/16" | 4.5mm | Medium signs, boxes | Moderate | Medium |
| 1/4" | 6mm | Sturdy signs, displays | Moderate | Deep |
| 3/8" | 9mm | Thick displays, stands | Difficult | Very Deep |
| 1/2" | 12mm | Heavy-duty applications | Very Difficult | Maximum |
| 3/4" | 18mm+ | Structural elements | Expert Only | Multiple Passes |

## Quality Indicators

| Quality Factor | High Quality | Poor Quality | How to Check |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Surface Finish | Smooth, clear | Scratched, cloudy | Visual inspection |
| Edge Quality | Straight, clean | Wavy, rough | Run finger along edge |
| Optical Clarity | Crystal clear | Hazy, distorted | Look through material |
| Thickness Consistency | ±0.1mm variation | ±0.5mm+ variation | Measure multiple points |
| Masking Film | Easy removal, no residue | Difficult, leaves residue | Peel test corner |
| Internal Stress | No stress marks | Visible stress patterns | Check under polarized light |

## Common Brands and Characteristics

| Brand | Type | Quality Level | Price Range | Notes |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Plexiglas | Cast | Premium | High | Industry standard |
| Lucite | Cast | Premium | High | Excellent clarity |
| Acrylite | Cast | High | Medium-High | Good laser performance |
| Optix | Extruded | Medium | Medium | Budget-friendly |
| Plaskolite | Mixed | Variable | Low-Medium | Check specifications |
| Generic | Usually Extruded | Variable | Low | Test before bulk purchase |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Rough cut edges | Speed too fast, power too low | Reduce speed, increase power |
| Melted/rounded edges | Power too high, speed too slow | Reduce power, increase speed |
| Cracking during cut | Material stress, wrong settings | Use cast acrylic, adjust settings |
| Poor engraving contrast | Wrong material type | Use cast acrylic for engraving |
| Chipping on cuts | Dull masking, wrong direction | Fresh masking, check cut direction |
| Uneven engraving depth | Warped material, uneven bed | Check material flatness |
| Burn marks | Power too high | Reduce power, increase passes |
| Incomplete cuts | Power too low, speed too fast | Increase power or reduce speed |

## Buying Tips

| Consider | Why It Matters | What to Look For |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Masking Film | Protects surface during cut | Easy removal, no residue |
| Thickness Accuracy | Important for layered designs | ±0.1mm tolerance or better |
| Brand Quality | Cast acrylic from known brands cuts cleaner | Established manufacturers |
| Sheet Size | Plan for bed size of your laser machine | Standard sizes: 12"x12", 24"x18" |
| Edge Condition | Damaged edges affect cutting | Straight, undamaged edges |
| Storage Condition | Heat/UV exposure degrades material | Cool, dry storage |
| Quantity Discounts | Bulk purchases reduce cost | Compare per-square-foot pricing |
| Return Policy | Important for testing compatibility | Supplier accepts returns |

## Safety Considerations

| Safety Aspect | Recommendation | Why Important |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Ventilation | Always use exhaust fan | Acrylic produces toxic fumes |
| Eye Protection | Wear laser safety glasses | Prevent eye damage |
| Fire Safety | Keep fire extinguisher nearby | Acrylic is flammable |
| Ventilation Testing | Check air flow regularly | Ensure proper fume extraction |
| Material Inspection | Check for unknown coatings | Some coatings release toxic gases |
| Emergency Stop | Know location of emergency stop | Quick shutdown if needed |

## Cost Analysis

| Factor | Cast Acrylic | Extruded Acrylic | Impact |
|--------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Material Cost | $3-8 per sq ft | $1-4 per sq ft | 2-3x difference |
| Waste Factor | Lower (cleaner cuts) | Higher (more test cuts) | 10-20% difference |
| Time Efficiency | Faster setup | More trial and error | 15-30% time difference |
| End Quality | Professional results | Variable results | Affects selling price |
| Repeat Reliability | Consistent results | Variable batch to batch | Customer satisfaction |

## Specialty Acrylic Types

| Type | Description | Best Use | Laser Performance |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| UV Filtering | Blocks UV rays | Outdoor applications | Good, but slower cutting |
| Anti-Static | Reduces static buildup | Electronics enclosures | Standard performance |
| Impact Modified | Higher impact resistance | High-stress applications | May have different melting point |
| Coloured Core | Different colour inside | Layered engraving effects | Excellent for two-tone engraving |
| Light Diffusing | Scatters light evenly | LED panels, lighting | Good, creates soft glow |
| Non-Glare | Reduces reflections | Display cases, frames | Standard performance |

## Project Planning Guide

| Project Type | Recommended Material | Thickness | Finish |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|---------|
