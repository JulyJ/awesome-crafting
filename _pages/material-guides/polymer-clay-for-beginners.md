## What is Polymer Clay?

Polymer clay is a versatile modeling compound made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles suspended in plasticizer. Unlike traditional clay, it doesn't dry out when exposed to air and must be baked in an oven to harden permanently. This makes it ideal for detailed work, as you can take your time sculpting without worrying about the clay drying out.
