## Why Lighting Matters in a Craft Room

Poor lighting leads to:

- Eye strain and fatigue  
- Colour mismatches  
- Missed details  
- Slower, less enjoyable crafting

Whether you’re sewing, painting, cutting vinyl, or sculpting miniatures, **the right lighting makes everything easier and more accurate.**

## 3 Lighting Types Every Craft Room Needs

| Type | Use | Benefits |
|------|-----|----------|
| **Ambient Lighting** | General room light | Base illumination, prevents eye fatigue |
| **Task Lighting** | Focused on workspace | Brightens detail areas, boosts precision |
| **Accent Lighting** | Highlight zones or decor | Adds warmth, focus, and mood |

---

## Best Light Types for Crafting

| Light Type | Description | Ideal For |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Daylight LED Bulbs** | Mimics natural light (5000–6500K) | True colour rendering |
| **Adjustable Task Lamps** | Directional, movable | Detailed work (sewing, miniatures, painting) |
| **Overhead Panels** | Wide room coverage | General space lighting |
| **Clip-On Lights** | Flexible and portable | Small craft stations, mobile carts |
| **Ring Lights** | Circular light with no shadows | Filming or photography of crafts |

---

## Avoid These Common Lighting Mistakes

- Using yellow “warm” lights = inaccurate colour
- Only relying on overhead light = shadows and fatigue
- No lighting behind your tools = hand shadows
- No dimming option = eye strain at night

---

## Shop Smart: What to Look for

- Brightness (Lumens): Look for **800+ lumens** for task areas  
- Colour Temperature: **5000K+ = daylight balanced**  
- Flicker-Free: Avoid headaches from low-quality LEDs  
- Adjustability: Gooseneck or arm lamps offer control  
- Energy Efficiency: LEDs use less power and last longer

## Final Tip

Test your lighting by holding up a **paint swatch, thread, or vinyl sheet**. If it looks the same in daylight and under your lights, **you’ve nailed it.**
