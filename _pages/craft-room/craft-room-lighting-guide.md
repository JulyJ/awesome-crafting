## Common Lighting Myths Debunked

| Myth | Reality | What to Do Instead |
|---|---|---|
| **"More watts = more light"** | Lumens measure brightness, not watts | Check lumens, aim for 50-100 per sq ft |
| **"All LEDs are the same"** | Quality varies greatly, cheap LEDs flicker, low CRI | Buy reputable brands, check CRI 90+ |
| **"Natural light is always best"** | Varies by time, weather, causes glare | Supplement with quality artificial lights |
| **"One ceiling light is enough"** | Creates shadows, insufficient for detailed work | Layer ambient + task + accent lighting |
| **"Smart bulbs aren't worth the cost"** | Pay for themselves in energy savings + convenience | Consider for frequently adjusted lights |
| **"You need expensive fixtures"** | Quality bulbs matter more than fixture cost | Invest in bulbs, fixtures can be budget |

## Lighting Assessment for Your Space

| Factor | Questions to Ask | Impact on Lighting Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Natural Light** | How many windows? Which direction? Obstructions? | More natural light = less artificial needed, consider color temp |
| **Room Size** | Square footage? Ceiling height? | Determines lumens needed, fixture types |
| **Crafts Performed** | Color-critical? Detail work? Photography? | Affects CRI, temperature, specialty lighting needs |
| **Time of Use** | Daytime, evening, or both? | Determines need for full-spectrum or warm options |
| **Budget** | Upfront investment available? Annual energy budget? | Prioritize improvements, ROI on LED upgrades |
| **Flexibility Needs** | One craft or multiple? Shared space? | Smart lighting, adjustable options valuable |
| **Installation Options** | Can you hardwire? Renter or owner? | Determines plug-in vs. installed options |

## Return on Investment: LED Upgrades

| Current Setup | Annual Cost | LED Upgrade Cost | New Annual Cost | Payback Period | 10-Year Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **5 Incandescent Bulbs** | $98.50 | $50 | $14.85 | 7 months | $786 |

*Based on 3 hours/day usage, $0.13/kWh*

## Final Recommendations

The best craft room lighting combines layers: quality overhead ambient lighting (4000-5000K, 90+ CRI), adjustable task lighting positioned to minimize shadows (5000-6500K), and natural light control. Invest in high-quality LED bulbs rather than expensive fixtures, prioritize adjustable options for flexibility, and consider smart lighting if you craft at different times or do multiple craft types.

Start with the essentials—overhead ambient and one excellent task light—then add specialized lighting as your crafts and budget allow. Proper lighting isn't an expense; it's an investment in your eyes, your work quality, and your crafting enjoyment for years to come.
