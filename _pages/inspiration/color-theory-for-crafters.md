## The Colour Wheel: A Crafter's Best Friend

The colourr wheel is a visual representation of colourur relationships. Understanding it is the first step to mastering colourour in your crafts.

| Colour Type | Description | Examples | Mixing Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary Colours** | The three basic colourrs from which all other coloururs are made. Cannot be created by mixing. | Red, Yellow, Blue | Pure pigments - no mixing required |
| **Secondary Colours** | Created by mixing two primary colourrs in equal proportions. | Orange (Red + Yellow), Green (Blue + Yellow), Violet (Red + Blue) | Mix adjacent primaries on wheel |
| **Tertiary Colours** | Created by mixing a primary and a secondary colourr. | Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, Blue-Violet, Red-Violet | Mix primary with adjacent secondary |
| **Quaternary Colours** | Created by mixing two tertiary colourrs or a primary with a tertiary. | Slate, Sage, Russet, Citron | Advanced mixing for subtle tones |

## Understanding Colour Properties

| Property | Definition | Impact on Crafts | How to Adjust |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hue** | The pure colourr itself (red, blue, green, etc.) | Determines the basic colourr family | Choose different positions on colourr wheel |
| **Saturation** | The intensity or purity of the colourr | Affects vibrancy and visual impact | Add grey to reduce, pure pigment to increase |
| **Value** | The lightness or darkness of a colourr | Creates depth and contrast | Add white (tint) or black (shade) |
| **Temperature** | Whether a colourr feels warm or cool | Influences mood and atmosphere | Warm: reds, oranges, yellows; Cool: blues, greens, purples |

## Common Colour Schemes

| Scheme | Description | Best For | Craft Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monochromatic** | Uses variations in lightness and saturation of a single colourr. | Creating a harmonious and calming effect. | Single-colourr quilts, gradient yarn projects |
| **Analogous** | Uses colourrs that are next to each other on the colourur wheel (3-5 colourrs). | Creating a sense of unity and serenity. | Nature-inspired projects, sunset themes |
| **Complementary** | Uses colourrs that are opposite each other on the colourur wheel. | Creating high contrast and visual excitement. | Holiday decorations, bold statement pieces |
| **Split-Complementary** | Uses one colourr plus the two colourrs adjacent to its complement. | High contrast with less tension than complementary. | Dynamic yet balanced compositions |
| **Triadic** | Uses three colourrs that are evenly spaced around the colourur wheel. | Creating a vibrant and balanced look. | Playful children's projects, festive decorations |
| **Tetradic (Rectangle)** | Uses four colourrs arranged in two complementary pairs. | Rich, complex palettes with multiple focal points. | Sophisticated quilts, elaborate arrangements |
| **Square** | Uses four colourrs evenly spaced around the colourur wheel. | Bold, dynamic designs with equal emphasis. | Modern geometric patterns, pop art styles |

## Advanced Colour Harmonies

| Harmony Type | Formula | Visual Effect | Best Applications |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Double Complementary** | Two sets of complementary colourrs | Rich, complex, potentially overwhelming | Large projects where variety is needed |
| **Near Complementary** | Almost opposite colourrs (within 30Â° of true complement) | Softer contrast than true complementary | Subtle tension without harshness |
| **Monochromatic Plus Accent** | Single colourr family with one contrasting accent | Unified with strategic pop of interest | Minimalist designs with focal points |
| **Neutral Plus Bright** | Greys, beiges, whites with one vivid colourr | Sophisticated with controlled energy | Modern, contemporary aesthetics |
