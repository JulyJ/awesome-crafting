## Strategies for Overcoming Creative Block

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| **Take a Break** | Step away from your project and do something else. A walk, a nap, or a different activity can help clear your head. |
| **Try a New Craft** | Experimenting with a new medium or technique can spark new ideas and help you see your work in a new light. |
| **Set Small, Achievable Goals** | Instead of trying to tackle a large project, break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. |
| **Create a Dedicated Workspace** | A clean and organized workspace can help you focus and feel more creative. |
| **Collaborate with Others** | Working with other crafters can be a great way to get new ideas and perspectives. |

## Creative Exercises to Spark Inspiration

| Exercise | Description |
|---|---|
| **The 10-Minute Challenge** | Set a timer for 10 minutes and create something without overthinking it. The goal is to just make, not to make something perfect. |
| **The Random Word Association** | Pick a random word from a book or dictionary and create something inspired by that word. |
| **The "What If?" Game** | Ask yourself "what if?" questions about your project. What if I used a different colour? What if I made it bigger? What if I used a different material? |
