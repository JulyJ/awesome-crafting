## Why Every Crafter Needs a Portfolio

A portfolio showcases your best work, demonstrates skill progression, attracts customers or clients, supports applications and opportunities, and serves as a visual resume.

## Photography Basics for Crafts

| Aspect | Good Practice | Poor Practice | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lighting** | Natural light, diffused, consistent | Harsh overhead, mixed temps, dim | Professional vs. amateur look |
| **Background** | Clean, simple, non-distracting | Cluttered, busy patterns, random | Product stands out vs. gets lost |
| **Angle** | Multiple angles, eye-level, detail | Only one angle, awkward perspective | Comprehensive vs. incomplete view |
| **Focus** | Sharp focus on product, blurred background | Blurry, everything in focus, distracting | Professional vs. unclear |
| **Composition** | Rule of thirds, negative space, balanced | Centered, cramped, unbalanced | Visually pleasing vs. awkward |
| **Editing** | Subtle color correction, crop, brightness | Over-saturated, heavy filters, distorted | Natural vs. fake appearance |

## DIY Product Photography Setup

| Equipment | Budget Option | Mid-Range Option | Professional Option | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Camera** | Smartphone (iPhone, Pixel) | Point-and-shoot (Canon, Sony) | DSLR/Mirrorless | Captures image |
| **Lighting** | Window light | Ring light ($40-80) | Softbox kit ($100-300) | Even, flattering light |
| **Background** | White poster board ($3) | Seamless paper roll ($15-30) | Professional backdrop ($50-150) | Clean, professional look |
| **Tripod** | Improvised stack/shelf | Basic smartphone tripod ($15-30) | Professional tripod ($50-200) | Stable, consistent shots |
| **Reflectors** | White cardboard/foam board | 5-in-1 reflector ($15-40) | Professional reflectors ($50-100) | Bounce light, reduce shadows |
| **Editing Software** | Free (Snapseed, Canva) | Lightroom Mobile ($5/mo) | Adobe Lightroom ($10/mo) | Color correction, cropping |

**Beginner Recommendation**: Smartphone + natural window light + white poster board + free editing app = professional results for under $10.

## Natural Light Photography Guide

| Time of Day | Light Quality | Best For | Avoid For | Tips |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Morning (8-10am)** | Soft, cool, gentle | Most products, true colors | Warm-toned products | Position near east-facing window |
| **Midday (11am-2pm)** | Harsh, direct, strong shadows | N/A (generally avoid) | Most photography | Use sheer curtain to diffuse |
| **Afternoon (3-5pm)** | Warm, golden, flattering | Warm products, lifestyle shots | Cool-toned products | West-facing window, manage shadows |
| **Overcast Days** | Diffused, even, soft shadows | Almost everything, true colors | High-contrast needs | Best natural light condition |
| **Blue Hour (dusk)** | Cool, moody, soft | Artistic shots, ambiance | Product detail photos | Requires longer exposure, tripod |

**Golden Rule**: Indirect natural light near a window on an overcast day = perfect craft photography lighting.

## Photo Composition Techniques

| Technique | How to Apply | Effect | Example Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rule of Thirds** | Place subject on imaginary grid lines, not center | Dynamic, visually interesting | Most product photos |
| **Negative Space** | Leave empty space around subject | Clean, modern, breathable | Minimalist products, high-end |
| **Flat Lay** | Arrange items on flat surface, shoot from above | Organized, storytelling, Instagram-friendly | Product groupings, supplies |
| **Eye-Level** | Camera at same height as product | Engaging, human perspective | Wearables, functional items |
| **Macro/Close-Up** | Fill frame with detail/texture | Shows craftsmanship, quality | Handmade details, texture |
| **Lifestyle/In-Context** | Product in real-life setting with person/scene | Helps buyer visualize, relatable | Clothing, home decor, usable items |
| **White Space** | Lots of empty white background | Clean, professional, product focus | E-commerce, catalog-style |

## Photo Editing Basics

| Adjustment | What It Does | When to Use | How Much? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brightness** | Lightens or darkens overall image | Dark photos, underexposed | Subtle—don't blow out whites |
| **Contrast** | Difference between lights and darks | Flat images, add depth | Moderate—avoid harsh |
| **Saturation** | Intensity of colors | Dull colors, need vibrancy | Minimal—oversaturation looks fake |
| **White Balance** | Corrects color temperature (warm/cool) | Colors look off, orange/blue tint | Until colors look natural |
| **Sharpness** | Clarity of edges and details | Slightly soft images | Light touch—over-sharpening looks bad |
| **Crop** | Remove unnecessary elements, improve composition | Better framing, distractions | As needed for composition |
| **Shadows/Highlights** | Lighten shadows, tone down bright areas | High contrast, lost detail | Moderate—natural look |

**Editing Philosophy**: Enhance, don't transform. Photos should look like the real product, just in the best light.

## Curating Your Best Work

| Curation Principle | How to Apply | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Quality Over Quantity** | 10 amazing photos > 50 mediocre ones | Attention span, professional impression |
| **Cohesive Style** | Similar editing, color palette, composition | Recognizable brand, polished look |
| **Show Range (Within Reason)** | Different projects, but related style/skill | Demonstrates capability without confusing |
| **Tell a Story** | Arrange in logical order, progression | Engagement, narrative, connection |
| **Remove Weak Work** | Regularly delete outdated/poor pieces | Portfolio only as strong as weakest piece |
| **Update Regularly** | Add new work, remove old | Shows active, evolving artist |

**The Portfolio Paradox**: More isn't better. A focused, excellent collection beats a scattered, comprehensive one.

## Digital Portfolio Platforms

## Portfolio Mistakes to Avoid

|---|---|---|---|
| **Customers/Buyers** | Beautiful products, price, availability | Finished work, lifestyle shots, easy purchase | Process, experiments, failed attempts |
| **Craft Show Jurors** | Quality, professionalism, variety, booth setup | Best work, range, professional photos, setup | Personal projects, unrelated work |

## Protecting Your Portfolio Images

| Threat | Protection Method | Effectiveness | Trade-Off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Image Theft** | Watermark on images | Medium—can be cropped | Detracts from aesthetics |
| **Idea Copying** | Share finished work only, not tutorials | Low—ideas hard to protect | Limits engagement |
| **Unauthorized Use** | Copyright notice, DMCA takedowns | High (legally) | Requires vigilance, legal action |
| **Low-Res Theft** | Only upload web-resolution images | High—unusable for print | None |
| **Product Replication** | Document creation dates, unique elements | Medium | Limited protection |

**Reality**: Sharing online means some risk—but visibility benefits usually outweigh theft risks. Protect legally, but don't hide your work.

## Pricing Your Portfolio Work (If Selling)

| Approach | When to Use | How to Present | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Display Prices Openly** | E-commerce, straightforward sales | Clear price on each listing | Transparency, quick decisions |
