## Troubleshooting

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Holes in Fabric**   | Hook is too large for the yarn.              | Go down a hook size to create a tighter gauge.            |
| **Losing Stitch Count**| Forgetting increases/decreases, missed stitch marker. | Use a stitch marker in the first stitch of every round.   |
| **Lumpy Stuffing**    | Stuffing with large clumps.                  | Pull apart stuffing into smaller, fluffier pieces before using. |
| **Parts are Floppy**  | Not sewn on securely.                        | Use more stitches and pull the yarn tight when sewing.    |
