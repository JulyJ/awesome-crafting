## What is 3D Paper Quilling?

3D paper quilling is the art of rolling, shaping, and assembling strips of paper into dimensional sculptures—like animals, flowers, figures, and decorative objects—by stacking and shaping basic coils and forms.

## Assembly Tips for 3D Forms

| Tip                                   | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Stack shapes vertically               | Build height and dimension                 |
| Use dome molds for consistency        | Create even halves for round forms         |
| Dry glue completely before adding layers | Prevents slippage and collapse           |
| Reinforce from inside with glue       | Adds durability for larger builds          |
| Pin pieces while drying               | Helps with balance and precision           |
| Build in sections                     | Assemble parts (like head/body) separately before final glue-up |

## Gluing Techniques

| Method                  | Description                                 | Best For                           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Edge Glue**           | Glue applied to outer edge of coils         | Joining layers or side pieces      |
| **Surface Glue**        | Glue bottom of shape to base                 | Assembling to platforms or scenery |
| **Internal Reinforcement** | Apply glue inside 3D structure            | Adds strength without changing appearance |
| **Pin-and-Dry**         | Use pins to hold forms while glue sets      | Tall or curved structures          |

## Finishing & Display Tips

| Tip                                 | Why It Helps                          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Seal finished sculpture with diluted glue or varnish | Increases strength, prevents fraying |
| Mount on wood or cardstock base     | Adds support and presentation appeal   |
| Use doming glaze or gloss           | Gives a glass-like shine               |
| Store away from moisture            | Paper is vulnerable to warping         |

## FAQ

**Can I make quilling sculptures without a dome mold?**  
Yes! Use rounded objects like marbles or the back of a spoon as a substitute.

**How do I make large quilling sculptures stable?**  
Use wider paper strips and reinforce internal layers with glue as you build.

**What kind of glue should I use?**  
Clear-drying white craft glue works best—avoid runny or watery glues.

**Can kids do 3D quilling?**  
Absolutely! Supervise with scissors and use larger shapes for ease.
