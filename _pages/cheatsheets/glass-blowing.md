| **Furnace** | A furnace that holds molten glass at around 2000Â°F.   |
| **Glory Hole**| A reheating chamber used to keep the glass workable.    |
| **Annealer**| A kiln used to slowly cool the finished piece, preventing it from cracking. |
| **Blowpipe**| A hollow steel tube used to gather and inflate the glass. |
| **Jacks**   | A tool used to shape the glass.                       |

|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Gather molten glass from the furnace.        | -                                                        |
| **2**  | Marver the gather to shape it.               | -                                                        |
| **3**  | Blow a small bubble into the glass.          | -                                                        |
| **4**  | Reheat the glass in the glory hole.          | -                                                        |

| **6**  | Transfer the piece to a punty.               | This allows you to work on the top of the piece.         |
| **7**  | Finish the piece and place it in the annealer.| The annealing process can take many hours.               |
