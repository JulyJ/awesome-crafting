| **1**  | Warp your loom.                              | Wind the warp thread onto the loom, keeping even tension. |
| **2**  | Create a base.                               | Weave a few rows of tabby weave at the bottom.           |
| **3**  | Weave your design.                           | Use different colours and techniques to create your image. |
| **4**  | Finish the weaving.                          | Weave a few more rows of tabby weave at the top.         |
| **5**  | Remove the weaving from the loom.            | Cut the warp threads and tie them off.                   |
| **6**  | Finish the back.                             | Weave in any loose ends on the back of the tapestry.     |
