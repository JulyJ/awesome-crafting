## FAQs

**Can I use outdoor moss for my art?**  
Yes, but clean and dry thoroughly. Baking at low temp or freezing can help eliminate pests.

**Will preserved moss grow?**  
No. It's treated to stay soft and coloured but will not regenerate or root.

**Is moss art suitable for bathrooms?**  
Preserved moss is ideal—high humidity can help it stay soft, and no light is needed.

**Can I combine moss with succulents or air plants?**  
Yes! In living walls, both work well with moss in shared humid environments.
