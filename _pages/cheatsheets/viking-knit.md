## The Viking Knit Process

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Create a "petal" base on the dowel.          | Make a loop of wire and then create several loops around it, like a flower. |
| **2**  | Begin the weave.                             | Pull the wire through the back of a loop to create a new loop. Continue around. |
| **3**  | Continue weaving up the dowel.               | Keep your loops consistent in size.                      |
| **4**  | Remove the weave from the dowel.             | Once you have the desired length, carefully slide it off. |
| **5**  | Draw the chain through the draw plate.       | Start with a large hole and progressively pull the chain through smaller holes. |
| **6**  | Finish the ends.                             | Use end caps or wire-wrap the ends to attach a clasp.    |
