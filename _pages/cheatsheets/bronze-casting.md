## The Lost-Wax Casting Process

*This is a complex process that requires a foundry and professional equipment.*

| Step # | Action                                       | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Create the original model.                   | Usually made of clay, wax, or plaster.                   |
| **2**  | Make a mold of the model.                    | A rubber mold is created to capture the detail.          |
| **3**  | Create a wax pattern.                        | Molten wax is poured into the rubber mold.               |
| **4**  | Chase the wax.                               | The wax pattern is refined and details are added.        |
| **5**  | Spruing.                                     | Wax rods (sprues) are added to the pattern to allow metal to flow in and gases to escape. |
| **6**  | Investment.                                  | The wax pattern is dipped in a ceramic slurry to create a shell. |
| **7**  | Burnout.                                     | The ceramic shell is fired in a kiln, which hardens the shell and melts out the wax. |
| **8**  | Casting.                                     | Molten bronze is poured into the hollow ceramic shell.   |
| **9**  | Devesting.                                   | The ceramic shell is broken away from the cooled bronze. |
| **10** | Metal Chasing and Finishing.                 | The sprues are cut off and the metal is cleaned, sanded, and polished. |
| **11** | Patination.                                  | Chemicals are applied to the surface to colour the bronze. |
