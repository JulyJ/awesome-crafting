## What Are Hydrogel Crafts?

Hydrogels are super-absorbent polymers that retain large amounts of water. Often found as tiny beads or crystals, they swell into squishy spheres when soaked. Hydrogel crafts use these water-filled forms for sensory play, décor, science projects, and eco-friendly art.

| **Essential Oils (Optional)**| Adds scent                        | Use only if not for kids' play        |
| **Glitter / Sequins**  | For mixed media use                     | Embed between layers or coat surfaces |

## Soaking & Colouring Guide

| Bead Size (dry) | Water Needed       | Soak Time   | Colouring Method                    |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2–3 mm           | 1 cup per tsp       | 4–6 hours   | Add dye to soaking water            |
| 6–8 mm           | 1 cup per tbsp      | 8–12 hours  | Use liquid watercolour or ink        |
| Mixed Sizes      | 1.5–2x standard     | 6–10 hours  | Soak in layers for colour control    |

**Tip:** For pastel shades, use less dye. For ombré effects, soak beads separately in colour gradients.

## Storage & Rehydration

| Storage Method        | Duration       | Notes                                |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **In Water (Covered)** | 1–2 weeks      | Keep clean and change water often     |
| **In Airtight Jar (Dry)** | Indefinitely | Shrinks over time, rehydrate easily   |
| **Open Air (Hydrated)**| Few days       | Slowly shrinks as it dries            |
| **Rehydrate**          | Soak in water again for 4–8 hrs | May not return to original clarity   |

## Safety Guidelines

| Rule                        | Reason                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Do not ingest               | Not food-safe; choking hazard            |
| Supervise small children    | Beads resemble candy or toys            |
| Avoid drain disposal        | May clog pipes                          |
| Use gloves if sensitive     | Some dyes or textures irritate skin     |
| Keep pets away              | Risk of accidental ingestion            |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                    | Cause                         | Solution                              |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Moldy beads**            | Dirty water or closed container | Use clean water and dry storage        |
| **Beads not expanding**    | Old or poor-quality stock     | Replace with fresh water beads         |
| **Dye doesn’t stick**      | Dyes added after soaking      | Colour water before bead hydration      |
| **Beads burst or break**   | Overhydration or rough handling | Use less water and gentle touch       |

## FAQ

**Can I reuse dried hydrogel beads?**  
Yes! Let them dry out completely, then rehydrate in clean water when needed.

**Are water beads biodegradable?**  
Some are partially biodegradable. Look for eco-friendly options if compostability is a concern.

**Can I use them with live plants?**  
Use only as a decorative element, not a substitute for soil in long-term plant care.

**What’s the best age range for hydrogel crafts?**  
Ages 4+ with supervision. Great for sensory and STEM learning activities.
