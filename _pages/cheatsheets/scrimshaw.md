## The Scrimshaw Process

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Prepare and polish your material.            | Sand the surface to a very smooth finish.                |
| **2**  | Transfer your design to the surface.         | Use a pencil or transfer paper.                          |
| **3**  | Engrave the design.                          | Use a scribe to carefully scratch the lines of your design. |
| **4**  | Apply ink to the surface.                    | Rub India ink over the entire design, making sure it gets into all the lines. |
| **5**  | Wipe away the excess ink.                    | Let the ink dry for a moment, then wipe the surface clean with a cloth. |
| **6**  | Final polish.                                | Give the piece a final polish with a clean, soft cloth.  |
