## What is Encaustic Painting?

Encaustic painting is an ancient art form using heated beeswax mixed with damar resin and pigments. The artist paints with molten wax and fuses each layer using heat, creating rich, textured, and luminous effects.

## Essential Tools & Materials

| Tool / Material         | Purpose                                 | Notes                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Beeswax**              | Primary medium                          | Filtered or natural; combined with damar resin |
| **Damar Resin**          | Adds hardness and durability            | Usually pre-blended in medium           |
| **Heat Source (Griddle)**| Melts and keeps encaustic medium warm   | Electric pancake griddle preferred      |
| **Metal Palette Cups**   | Holds melted wax                        | Use multiple for different colours       |
| **Natural Bristle Brushes** | Apply molten wax                    | Avoid synthetic brushes—they melt       |
| **Heat Gun / Torch**     | Fuses wax layers together               | Helps remove bubbles and blends layers  |
| **Encaustic Medium**     | Beeswax + damar mix for base and blending | Available pre-made                      |
| **Pigments / Encaustic Paints** | Colourant added to wax          | Use dry pigments or ready-made paints   |
| **Scrapers / Etching Tools** | Carving or texturing wax surface   | Rigid tools for encaustic techniques    |
| **Ventilation Fan**      | Disperses fumes                         | Especially when using a torch           |

## Suitable Painting Surfaces

| Surface Type        | Prep Required     | Notes                                |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Wood Panel (Birch)** | None if smooth | Ideal support—rigid and absorbent     |
| **Cradled Panel**    | Optional sanding | Adds depth and durability             |
| **Cardboard (Not Ideal)**| Warps with heat| Use for quick tests only              |
| **Paper (Thick)**    | Mount to wood     | Use watercolour or cotton rag paper    |
| **Canvas (Optional)**| Mount to board    | Only if tightly stretched and primed  |
| **Ceramic Tile / Metal** | Clean well     | Unique look, but wax may flake        |

## Encaustic Medium Recipes

| Type                | Ratio (Beeswax : Damar) | Notes                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Standard Medium** | 8:1                      | Good balance of hardness and flexibility |
| **Soft Medium**     | 10:1                     | Easier to blend, softer finish        |
| **Hard Finish**     | 6:1                      | Best for high-traffic surfaces        |

## FAQ

**Can I use regular candles or crayons?**  
No—only use beeswax + damar resin. Crayons contain additives that burn or smoke.

**Do I need to varnish or seal encaustic art?**  
No. Encaustic work remains durable and archival when properly fused and polished.

**How long does encaustic paint take to cure?**  
Surface dries quickly, but full cure takes 1–2 weeks. Polish only after curing.

**Can I hang encaustic art in sunlight?**  
Avoid direct heat or sunlight—it may soften or distort the wax.
