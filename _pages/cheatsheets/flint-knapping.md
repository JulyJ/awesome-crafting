## The Process of Making an Arrowhead

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Start with a large flake or spall.           | This will be your preform.                               |
| **2**  | Use percussion to thin and shape the preform.| Create a basic triangular shape.                         |
| **3**  | Switch to pressure flaking.                  | Refine the edges and create a sharp point.               |
| **4**  | Create notches for hafting (optional).       | Use a small, sharp pressure flaker.                      |
