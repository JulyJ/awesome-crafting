## Cyanotype Chemistry

*Warning: Handle chemicals with care. Wear gloves and eye protection.*

| Chemical                   | Formula                               | Role in Process                               |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Potassium Ferricyanide** | K₃[Fe(CN)₆]                           | Part A of the sensitizer solution.            |
| **Ferric Ammonium Citrate**| (NH₄)₅[Fe(C₆H₄O₇)₂]                   | Part B of the sensitizer solution.            |

**Standard Recipe:**
*   **Solution A:** 25g Ferric Ammonium Citrate in 100ml water.
*   **Solution B:** 10g Potassium Ferricyanide in 100ml water.

*Store solutions in separate, labeled, light-proof bottles. They will last for months.*

## Suitable Papers & Fabrics

| Material      | Characteristics                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Paper**     | Heavyweight, natural fiber papers (cotton rag, watercolor paper) work best. |
| **Fabric**    | Natural fibers like cotton, linen, silk, and canvas absorb the chemistry well. |

## The Cyanotype Process

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Mix sensitizer solution.                     | In a dimly lit room, mix equal parts of Solution A and B. |
| **2**  | Coat your paper or fabric.                   | Apply a thin, even coat with a brush or coating rod.     |
| **3**  | Let it dry completely.                       | Dry in a dark place. A hairdryer can speed this up.      |
| **4**  | Create your composition.                     | Arrange objects (plants, lace, etc.) or a negative on the surface. |
| **5**  | Expose to UV light.                          | Place in direct sunlight. Exposure times vary (5-30 mins). |
| **6**  | Rinse in water.                              | Wash the print in a tray of cool water for 5-10 minutes. |
| **7**  | Dry your print.                              | Hang to dry. The blue color will deepen as it oxidizes.  |

## Exposure Guide

| Exposure Level  | Appearance During Exposure                  | Result                                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Under-exposed**| Pale blue or yellow-green.                  | Washed-out, light blue print.               |
| **Correctly exposed**| Turns to a bronze or grey-blue color.       | Deep Prussian blue with clear highlights.   |
| **Over-exposed**| Dark grey or slate blue.                    | Dark blue print with loss of detail in highlights. |

## Toning Cyanotypes

| Toning Agent | Color Result      | Process                                               |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Black Tea**| Brown/Sepia       | Steep print in strong black tea after rinsing.        |
| **Washing Soda**| Yellow-brown      | Briefly dip in a weak washing soda solution.          |
| **Tannic Acid**| Purple/Black      | Bathe print in a tannic acid solution.                |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem               | Possible Cause                               | Solution                                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Print is entirely blue**| Paper was exposed to light before use.       | Ensure paper is coated and dried in a dark room.          |
| **Weak or pale print**| Under-exposure, weak chemistry.              | Increase exposure time, mix fresh chemistry.              |
| **Blue stain in highlights**| Not rinsed long enough.                      | Rinse for a longer period, changing the water a few times. |
