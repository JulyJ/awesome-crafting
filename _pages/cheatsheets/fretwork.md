|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scroll Saw**      | The primary tool for fretwork. It has a fine blade that allows for intricate cuts. |
| **Fret Saw**        | A hand-powered saw that can also be used for fretwork. |
| **Drill**           | For making starter holes for interior cuts.           |

## Scroll Saw Blade Types

| Blade Type          | Use                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard Tooth**  | Good for general purpose cutting.                         |
| **Skip-Tooth**      | Has a gap between teeth, which helps clear sawdust.       |
| **Reverse-Tooth**   | Has teeth pointing up at the bottom of the blade, which reduces tear-out on the underside of the wood. |
| **Spiral Blade**    | Can cut in any direction without turning the workpiece.   |

## The Fretwork Process

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Choose a pattern and transfer it to the wood.| Use carbon paper or a spray adhesive.                    |
| **2**  | Drill starter holes for all interior cuts.   | The hole should be large enough for your blade to pass through. |
| **3**  | Make the interior cuts first.                | Thread the blade through a starter hole and re-attach it to the saw. |
| **4**  | Make the exterior cuts.                      | Carefully follow the lines of your pattern.              |
| **5**  | Sand the finished piece.                     | Use small files or sandpaper to smooth all the edges.    |
