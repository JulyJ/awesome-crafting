| **Uneven folds** | Rushing, poor alignment | Take time, use ruler | Work slowly, check alignment |
| **Won't hold shape** | Weak creases, wrong paper | Press firmly, try heavier paper | Use bone folder |
| **Model collapses** | Insufficient tension | Reinforce key folds | Follow tension guidelines |
| **Can't follow diagram** | Complex symbols | Study symbol guide first | Practice basic symbols |
| **Proportions wrong** | Measurement errors | Double-check each step | Use precise measurements |
