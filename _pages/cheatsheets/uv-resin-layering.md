## What Is UV Resin Layering?

UV resin layering is a technique where clear resin is cured in multiple thin stages to build up depth, encase objects, or create three-dimensional effects. Each layer is cured under UV light before adding the next.

## Basic Tools & Materials

| Item                  | Use                                      | Notes                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **UV Resin**           | Main medium                             | Choose crystal clear or doming type   |
| **UV Lamp**            | Cures each resin layer                   | 36W+ recommended for efficient curing |
| **Silicone Mold**      | Holds resin during curing                | Flexible for easy demolding           |
| **Toothpick / Spatula**| Spreads resin or removes bubbles         | Use plastic or silicone tools         |
| **Glitters / Inclusions**| Embedded materials                    | Dried flowers, beads, charms, foil    |
| **Protective Gloves**  | Skin safety                              | Nitrile preferred                     |
| **Alcohol Spray**      | Pops bubbles on surface                  | Use 90%+ isopropyl alcohol            |
| **Face Mask**          | For ventilation and odor                 | Especially for enclosed spaces        |

## UV Resin Layering Workflow

| Step              | Description                               | Tip                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **1. Pour Thin Base Layer** | ~1–2 mm clear resin                | Cure fully before adding anything     |
| **2. Embed First Object**   | Place item gently into tacky or cured base | Don’t press too hard                |
| **3. Cover with Resin**     | Add thin layer above object         | Avoid air bubbles                     |
| **4. Cure Under UV Lamp**   | 1–2 min per layer                   | Rotate if lamp isn’t overhead         |
| **5. Repeat for Layers**    | Build gradually                    | Cure each layer separately            |
| **6. Finish with Doming Layer** | Round, glossy top finish        | Add clear resin last and cure fully   |

## Cure Time Guidelines

| Resin Layer Thickness | Estimated Cure Time (36–54W UV Lamp) | Notes                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 mm or less           | 1–2 minutes                           | Very fast cure                      |
| 2–3 mm                 | 2–3 minutes                           | Cure both sides if possible         |
| 4 mm or more (Not recommended in one layer) | Layer instead    | Avoid thick pour to prevent bubbles |
| Doming Layer           | 2–4 minutes                           | Ensure strong surface light         |

## Common Inclusions & Embedding Tips

| Object Type        | Layer Position    | Notes                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Dried Flowers**    | Middle or top     | Press flat and dry thoroughly first    |
| **Glitter & Foil**   | Mix into any layer| Use sparingly to avoid cloudiness      |
| **Charms / Beads**   | Middle layers     | Embed in partially cured resin to hold |
| **Printed Paper**    | Mid-layer         | Seal with packing tape or Mod Podge    |
| **Glow Powder**      | Bottom or center  | Mix well into resin                    |
| **Resin Stickers**   | Surface or dome   | Cure fully and dome to seal edges      |

## Surface Finishing Options

| Finish Type         | Description                            | How-To                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Glossy Dome**      | Shiny rounded surface                   | Add final thick clear layer             |
| **Matte Finish**     | Soft-touch effect                       | Sand with fine grit and finish spray    |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                     | Cause                                 | Solution                               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Sticky Surface**         | Under-cured or thick pour             | Cure longer, work in thinner layers     |
| **Bubbles in Layers**      | Trapped air or over-mixing            | Pour slowly, use heat or alcohol spray  |
| **Cloudy Resin**           | Moisture or bad mixing                | Use dry inclusions, avoid water-based inks |
| **Layer Separation**       | Incomplete curing between layers      | Ensure full cure before next layer      |
| **Yellowing Over Time**    | UV exposure or poor-quality resin     | Store in dark place, use high-quality resin |

## Safety & Storage

| Tip                         | Why It’s Important                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Work in a ventilated area   | UV resin can emit fumes               |
| Wear gloves and mask        | Prevent skin and inhalation exposure  |
| Cure thoroughly             | Uncured resin can remain toxic        |
| Store resin in cool dark place | Light or heat degrades resin      |
| Clean spills immediately    | UV resin hardens fast once exposed    |

## FAQ

**Can I use a flashlight to cure UV resin?**  
Yes, but it must be a UV light (365–405 nm range). Curing may take longer.

**Why is my resin tacky after curing?**  
Either the light is too weak, layer is too thick, or it hasn’t fully cured.

**How many layers is too many?**  
There’s no hard limit, but very thick pieces should be layered carefully to avoid internal stress or distortion.

**Can I use UV resin outdoors?**  
Yes, but avoid direct sunlight during layering—UV light may cure it too fast and unevenly.
