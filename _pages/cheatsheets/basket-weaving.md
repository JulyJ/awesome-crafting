## Starting a Round Reed Basket

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Cut and soak your stakes.                    | Cut an even number of stakes.                            |
| **2**  | Lay out the base.                            | Criss-cross two groups of stakes (e.g., 4 over 4).       |
| **3**  | Begin weaving the base with a twining pattern.| This locks the stakes in place.                          |
| **4**  | Separate the stakes.                         | Once the base is the desired size, separate the stakes evenly. |
| **5**  | Upset the stakes.                            | Bend the stakes upwards to form the sides.               |
| **6**  | Weave the sides.                             | Continue with your chosen weaving pattern.               |
| **7**  | Finish the rim.                              | Trim the stakes and lash the rim.                        |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem               | Possible Cause                               | Solution                                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reed is cracking**  | Reed is too dry.                             | Keep a spray bottle handy to mist your work as you weave. |
| **Uneven sides**      | Inconsistent tension on the weaver.          | Pull each row of weaving down snugly against the previous one. |
| **Gaps in weaving**   | Not packing the rows tightly enough.         | Use a flat-head screwdriver or a packing tool to push rows together. |
