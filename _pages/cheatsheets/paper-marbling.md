## The Ebru Marbling Process

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Prepare the size.                            | Mix carrageenan with water and let it sit for several hours. |
| **2**  | Pre-treat the paper.                         | Sponge a thin layer of alum solution onto the paper and let it dry. |
| **3**  | Float the paints.                            | Drop or flick paints onto the surface of the size.       |
| **4**  | Create a pattern.                            | Use a stylus, rake, or comb to move the paints around.   |
| **5**  | Lay the paper.                               | Carefully lay the alum-treated paper onto the surface of the size. |
| **6**  | Lift and rinse.                              | Peel the paper off, and gently rinse off the excess size. |
| **7**  | Dry the paper.                               | Hang to dry or lay flat on a rack.                       |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem               | Possible Cause                               | Solution                                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Paints sink**       | Size is too thin, or paint is too heavy.     | Add more carrageenan to the size. Add a drop of dispersant (ox gall) to the paint. |
| **Colors are pale**   | Paper was not treated with alum.             | Ensure paper is properly treated with alum before marbling. |
| **Pattern is muddy**  | Over-working the paints, colors are bleeding.| Use a lighter touch with the stylus/comb.                 |
