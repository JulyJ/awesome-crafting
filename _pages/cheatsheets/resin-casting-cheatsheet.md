## Resin & Epoxy Types Overview

| Type | Description | Best Use | Cure Time | Safety Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Epoxy Resin** | Two-part, clear or tinted | Jewelry, coatings, art | 12-48 hours | Use gloves, ventilate area |
| **Polyester Resin** | Fast curing, stronger smell | Casting large items | 15-30 mins | Use respirator, well ventilated |
| **UV Resin** | Cures under UV light quickly | Small projects, jewelry | 1-5 mins | Avoid skin contact, use UV light safely |
| **Polyurethane Resin** | Durable, flexible | Functional parts, molds | Minutes to hours | Protective gear required |
| **Casting Resin** | Low viscosity, bubble resistant | Molds, detailed pieces | 24-72 hours | Follow safety precautions |

## Essential Tools & Materials

| Tool / Material | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| **Mixing Cups & Sticks** | For accurate resin mixing | Use disposable or dedicated tools |
| **Digital Scale** | Measure resin and hardener precisely | Accuracy critical for curing |
| **Silicone Molds** | Shapes for casting | Various sizes and designs |
| **Protective Gear** | Gloves, respirator, goggles | Safety first, avoid skin contact & fumes |
| **Heat Gun / Torch** | Removes bubbles after pouring | Use carefully to avoid overheating |
| **Colourants & Pigments** | Add colour and effects | Use resin-specific dyes and powders |
| **Release Agent** | Easier mold release | Apply before casting to prevent sticking |
| **Mixing Tips** | Slow, thorough mixing | Minimizes bubbles and uneven curing |

## Mixing Ratios & Curing Tips

| Resin Type | Common Ratio (Resin:Hardener) | Pot Life | Cure Time | Best Practices |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Epoxy Resin** | 1:1 or 2:1 (varies by brand) | 20-40 mins | 12-48 hrs | Mix slowly, scrape sides thoroughly |
| **Polyester Resin** | Usually 100:1 (resin:hardener) | 5-15 mins | 15-30 mins | Work quickly, strong odor |
| **UV Resin** | Single component | N/A | 1-5 mins (UV lamp) | Thin layers, cure completely |
| **Polyurethane Resin** | Varies | Minutes | Minutes to hours | Measure carefully, quick curing |
| **Casting Resin** | Usually 1:1 or specific ratio | 10-30 mins | 24-72 hrs | Ensure molds are clean |

## Bubble Prevention & Removal

| Technique | Description | Tips |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Slow Mixing** | Avoid whipping air into resin | Stir gently and slowly |
| **Warm Resin** | Heat resin slightly before mixing | Makes bubbles rise faster |
| **Heat Gun / Torch** | Pass over surface to pop bubbles | Keep moving to avoid scorching |
| **Vacuum Chamber** | Removes air bubbles pre-pour | Used for professional results |
| **Pressure Pot** | Compresses bubbles after pouring | Requires special equipment |

---

## Safety Guidelines

| Safety Aspect | Recommendations |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Ventilation** | Always work in well-ventilated areas or outdoors |
| **Protective Gear** | Wear nitrile gloves, safety glasses, and respirator masks |
| **Skin Contact** | Avoid direct contact, wash immediately if exposed |
| **Disposal** | Follow local regulations for resin waste |
| **Storage** | Keep resin containers tightly closed and out of sunlight |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Sticky or Tacky Surface** | Insufficient curing time or wrong ratio | Extend curing, check measurements |
| **Cracking or Yellowing** | UV exposure or improper mixing | Store away from sunlight, mix thoroughly |
| **Bubbles in Final Piece** | Whipped air or cold resin | Warm resin, slow mixing, heat gun treatment |
| **Uneven Curing** | Thick pours or cold environment | Use thinner layers, cure in warm area |
| **Mold Sticking** | No release agent or poor mold quality | Use release spray, clean molds |

---

## Maintenance & Storage

| Item | Care Instructions | Frequency |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Mixing Cups & Tools | Clean immediately after use | After each project |
| Resin Containers | Store sealed, away from heat/light | Always |
| Silicone Molds | Clean with mild soap and water | After every use |
| Workspace | Cover and ventilate properly | Daily |
