## FAQ

**Can enameling be done on aluminum?**  
Aluminum is difficult to enamel due to its oxide layer and low melting point; not recommended.

**What temperature is ideal for firing enamel?**  
Typically between 1400°F and 1500°F (760°C - 815°C), depending on enamel type.

**How many layers of enamel are needed?**  
Usually 2-4 layers, allowing firing between each layer for depth and durability.

**Can I use a toaster oven for enameling?**  
Standard toaster ovens don’t reach high enough temperatures for proper enameling.
