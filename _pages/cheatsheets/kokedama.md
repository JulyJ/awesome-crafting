## Step-by-Step Kokedama Assembly

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Prepare your plant.                          | Gently remove most of the soil from the roots.           |
| **2**  | Mix your soil.                               | Add water slowly until it holds together in a ball.      |
| **3**  | Form the soil ball.                          | Split the ball in half, place roots inside, and reform the ball. |
| **4**  | Wrap with sheet moss.                        | Cover the entire soil ball with a layer of moss.         |
| **5**  | Wrap with twine.                             | Start by wrapping horizontally, then crisscross in all directions. |
| **6**  | Secure the twine.                            | Tie a tight knot and trim the excess.                    |
| **7**  | Water your Kokedama.                         | Submerge the ball in water for 10-20 minutes.            |

## Watering Your Kokedama

| Method      | How to Do It                                               | Frequency                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Soaking** | Submerge the moss ball in a bowl of water for 10-20 minutes. | When the ball feels light and dry.      |
| **Misting** | Spray the moss and plant leaves with water.                | Daily, especially for humidity-loving plants. |

**How to know when to water:** The easiest way is by weight. A dry Kokedama will feel very light. A well-watered one will be heavy and saturated.

## Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem               | Possible Cause                  | Solution                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brown, Crispy Leaves**| Under-watering or low humidity. | Water more frequently, mist daily.                        |
| **Yellow Leaves**     | Over-watering.                  | Allow the ball to dry out more between waterings.         |
| **Mold on Moss**      | Poor air circulation, too wet.  | Increase air flow, water less. Can be treated with a fungicide. |
| **Ball Falling Apart**| Not wrapped tightly enough.     | Re-wrap with more twine, ensuring it's secure.            |
