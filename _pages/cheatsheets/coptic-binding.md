## What is Coptic Binding?

Coptic binding is a centuries-old bookbinding technique using exposed chain stitches along the spine. This method allows books to lay flat when open, making it ideal for sketchbooks, journals, and artists' books.

## FAQ

**Do I need special thread?**  
Waxed linen or polyester thread works best—avoid stretchy threads like embroidery floss.

**Can I glue the spine instead of stitching?**  
Not for Coptic binding. The stitch structure is what allows the book to open flat.

**Can I add pockets or inserts?**  
Yes! Fold-out pages, envelopes, or tip-ins can be sewn right into signatures.

**How durable is Coptic binding?**  
Very durable for everyday journals and sketchbooks, especially if stitched cleanly.
