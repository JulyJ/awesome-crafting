## The Oil Gilding Process

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Prepare and prime your surface.              | Surface should be smooth and non-porous.                 |
| **2**  | Apply a thin, even coat of adhesive size.    | -                                                        |
| **3**  | Let the size come to tack.                   | This can take from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the size. It should feel like the back of a sticky note. |
| **4**  | Apply the metal leaf.                        | Use a gilder's tip to lay the leaf onto the tacky size.  |
| **5**  | Tamp down the leaf and brush away excess.    | Use a soft brush.                                        |
| **6**  | Seal the surface (optional but recommended). | Use a clear varnish to protect the leaf.                 |
