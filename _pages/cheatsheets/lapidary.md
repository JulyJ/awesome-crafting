## Creating a Cabochon

| Step # | Action                                       | Notes                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | Select a slab and draw your shape.           | -                                                        |
| **2**  | Trim the slab to the rough shape.            | Use a trim saw.                                          |
| **3**  | Attach the stone to a dop stick.             | Use dopping wax.                                         |
| **4**  | Grind the stone to its final shape.          | Use coarse grinding wheels first, then move to finer ones. |
| **5**  | Sand the stone smooth.                       | Work through progressively finer grits of sandpaper.     |
| **6**  | Polish the stone.                            | Use a polishing compound like cerium oxide on a leather pad. |
