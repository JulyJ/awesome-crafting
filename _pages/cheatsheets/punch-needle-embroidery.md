## FAQ

**Can I use regular embroidery needles for punch needle?**  
No, punch needle tools have a hollow shaft designed for looping thread/yarn.

**How tight should my fabric be?**  
Taut but not overstretched — too tight makes punching hard; too loose causes uneven loops.

**What thread thickness is best for beginners?**  
Start with medium-weight embroidery floss or wool yarn size 3–4 mm needles.

**Can I wash punch needle projects?**  
Spot clean only to avoid distorting loops and fabric.
