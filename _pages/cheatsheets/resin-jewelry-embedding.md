## FAQ

**Can I use live flowers in resin?**  
No—fresh flowers rot and create bubbles. Always use fully dried, sealed flowers.

**How do I avoid bubbles in resin?**  
Warm resin slightly, pour slowly, and pop bubbles with a heat gun or toothpick.

**Can I mix UV and epoxy resin?**  
Not in the same layer. You can dome UV resin on top of cured epoxy if needed.

**Is UV resin safe for kids?**  
Not recommended. Use with adult supervision and proper PPE in ventilated space.
