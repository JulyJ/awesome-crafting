## FAQ

**Do I need to seal between paint layers?**  
No, but make sure each layer is dry before painting over it to avoid lifting or muddying colours.

**Can I use oil paints for tole painting?**  
Traditionally yes, but acrylics are now preferred for their fast drying time and ease of use.

**How do I transfer a design onto the surface?**  
Use graphite or transfer paper, then trace with stylus or pencil.

**What’s the difference between tole painting and one-stroke painting?**  
Tole painting is the broader folk art tradition; one-stroke is a specific technique within it.
