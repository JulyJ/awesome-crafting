## Foraging Basics

| Tip                             | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Know your local region           | Use guidebooks or apps to identify safe plants                          |
| Forage ethically                 | Take only 10% of what's available; never from protected land            |
| Use gloves and scissors          | Avoid skin irritation or plant damage                                   |
| Avoid pollutants                 | Never collect near roads, industrial areas, or sprayed farmland         |
| Record locations & bloom cycles | Helps with seasonal planning and sustainability                         |
