## Vector vs. Raster for Laser Machines

| Type | Description | Laser Action | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vector Graphics** | Made of paths, lines, and curves. Scalable without pixelation. | **Cutting & Engraving Lines** | Clean cuts, precise outlines, text, geometric patterns. |
| **Raster Graphics** | Made of pixels (like photos). Pixelate when scaled up. | **Engraving (Shading)** | Photos, detailed images, shading effects. |

## Essential Design Software

| Software | Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Adobe Illustrator** | Vector | Industry standard, powerful tools. | Subscription, steep learning curve. | Professional designs, complex vector art. |
| **Inkscape** | Vector | Free, open-source, good for basic shapes. | Less intuitive, fewer advanced features. | Beginners, simple vector designs. |
| **CorelDRAW** | Vector | Popular in laser industry, user-friendly. | Paid software. | General laser design, signage. |
| **LightBurn** | Both | Designed specifically for laser machines. | Paid, not a full design suite. | Direct control over laser settings, G-code generation. |

## Optimizing Your Design for Laser

| Design Element | Optimization Tip |
|---|---|
| **Line Thickness** | Use "hairline" or 0.001" thickness for cutting lines. |
| **Colors** | Assign specific RGB colors to different operations (e.g., red for cut, black for engrave). |
| **Text** | Convert text to paths/outlines to ensure fonts render correctly on any machine. |
| **Overlapping Lines** | Remove duplicate or overlapping lines to prevent multiple passes and burning. |
| **Material Kerf** | Account for the laser beam's width (kerf) for precise fits. |

## Common File Formats

| Format | Type | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** | Vector | Web-friendly, good for cutting and line engraving. |
| **DXF (Drawing Exchange Format)** | Vector | Common in CAD and older laser software. |
| **AI (Adobe Illustrator)** | Vector | Native Illustrator format, preserves layers. |
| **JPG, PNG, BMP** | Raster | For photo engraving and shading. |
| **PDF (Portable Document Format)** | Both | Can contain both vector and raster data. |

## Material Considerations in Design

| Material | Design Impact |
|---|---|
| **Wood** | Engraves with a brown/darker tone. Consider grain direction. |
| **Acrylic** | Engraves with a frosted look. Cuts cleanly. |
| **Leather** | Engraves with a dark, debossed effect. Can smell strongly. |
| **Paper/Cardstock** | Can be cut very intricately. Engraving creates a subtle burn. |
