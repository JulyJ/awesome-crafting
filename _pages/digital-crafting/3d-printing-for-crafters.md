## How 3D Printing Works (FDM)

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| **1. Design** | Create a 3D model using software (CAD) or download a pre-made file (STL). |
| **2. Slice** | Use a slicer program to convert the 3D model into layers and generate G-code (printer instructions). |
| **3. Print** | The printer heats plastic filament and extrudes it layer by layer onto a build plate. |
| **4. Finish** | Remove supports, sand, paint, or assemble your 3D printed object. |

## Common 3D Printing Materials (Filaments)

| Material | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PLA (Polylactic Acid)** | Easy to print, biodegradable | Brittle, low heat resistance | Decorative items, prototypes |
| **PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)** | Durable, good layer adhesion | Can string, requires higher temps | Functional parts, outdoor use |
| **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)** | Strong, heat resistant | Warps easily, requires enclosure | Mechanical parts, high-stress applications |
| **TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)** | Flexible, rubber-like | Slow to print, can be tricky | Flexible parts, phone cases |

## Integrating 3D Prints into Crafts

| Craft Type | 3D Print Application |
|---|---|
| **Jewelry Making** | Custom bezels, unique pendant shapes, earring components. |
| **Resin Art** | Molds for resin casting, embedded objects. |
| **Sewing/Textiles** | Custom buttons, zipper pulls, fabric stamps. |
| **Paper Crafts** | Embossing plates, stencils, custom paper clips. |
| **Miniatures** | Furniture, accessories, custom figures. |
