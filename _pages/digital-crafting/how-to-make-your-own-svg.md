## Design Process Overview

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Sketch or plan your idea |
| 2 | Open tool (Inkscape, Gravit) |
| 3 | Use shape/pen tools to draw design |
| 4 | Combine, subtract, and align |
| 5 | Save as `.svg` and test it |

## Tips for SVG Success

| Tip | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|
| Use only vector shapes | Raster parts won't cut |
| Simplify layers | Avoid overly complex cuts |
| Test on scrap material first | Prevents wasted stock |
| Name files clearly | Easier to reuse later |

## File Export Settings

| Tool | Setting to Choose |
|------|-------------------|
| Inkscape | Save as Plain SVG |
| Gravit Designer | Export > SVG |
| Illustrator (if used) | SVG 1.1, no CSS |
