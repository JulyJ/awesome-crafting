## Understanding Laser Engraving

Laser engraving uses a focused laser beam to remove material from the surface, creating permanent marks, designs, or images. Unlike cutting (which goes all the way through), engraving creates depth and contrast on the material surface, perfect for personalization, artwork, and functional marking.

### Engraving vs. Cutting vs. Marking

| Process | Material Removal | Depth | Speed | Applications | Power Required |
|---------|-----------------|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Engraving** | Vaporizes surface material | 0.1-3mm deep | Slow-Medium | Artwork, personalization | Medium-High |
| **Marking** | Discolors surface only | Surface level | Fast | Serial numbers, logos | Low-Medium |
| **Cutting** | Goes completely through | Full thickness | Medium-Slow | Shapes, parts, pieces | High |
| **Etching** | Very light surface removal | <0.5mm | Fast | Delicate details, glass | Low-Medium |

### Why Laser Engraving is a Game-Changer

| Advantage | Traditional Methods | Laser Engraving | Business Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Personalization Speed** | Minutes per item (hand) | Seconds per item | High-volume capability |
| **Design Complexity** | Limited to skill | Any digital image | Unlimited creativity |
| **Consistency** | Variable by hand | Perfect every time | Scalable production |
| **Material Versatility** | Tool-specific | One machine, many materials | Diverse product line |
| **Permanent Results** | Can fade/wear | Lasts lifetime of product | Quality assurance |
| **No Consumables** | Ink, blades, bits | Just electricity | Lower operating costs |

## Materials & Engraving Results

### Wood Engraving

| Wood Type | Contrast Quality | Detail Capability | Best Use | Cost per Board | Prep Required |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Maple** | Excellent dark contrast | Very High | Cutting boards, portraits | $15-40 | Light sanding |
| **Cherry** | Beautiful warm tones | High | Premium gifts, plaques | $20-50 | Minimal |
| **Walnut** | Medium contrast | High | Dark backgrounds, boxes | $25-60 | Light sanding |
| **Alder** | Good contrast | Medium-High | Budget-friendly plaques | $10-25 | Sand well |
| **Basswood** | Fair contrast | Very High | Fine detail work | $12-30 | Seal before engraving |
