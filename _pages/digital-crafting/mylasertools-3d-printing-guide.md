|---------|------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Dimensional Signs** | Raised letters | Backing board | Glue letters to board | High - premium look |
| **Layered Ornaments** | 3D embellishments | Flat decorative layers | Glue/nail together | High - unique depth |
| **Keychains** | Thick charm/pendant | Thin backing layer | Rivet or glue | Medium - textured interest |
| **Gift Boxes** | Custom lid ornament | Box structure | Attach ornament | Very High - luxury packaging |

**Why Combine Both:**
- **Unique products**: Competitors rarely offer hybrid items
- **Premium pricing**: Justify 50-100% higher prices
- **Efficient production**: Use each technology's strengths
- **Differentiation**: Stand out in crowded markets
