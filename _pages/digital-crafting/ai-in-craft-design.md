## AI Tools for Idea Generation

| Tool Type | Description | Craft Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Text-to-Image Generators** | Create unique images from text prompts. | Generate patterns for fabric, inspiration for paintings, unique character designs for amigurumi. |
| **Style Transfer** | Apply the artistic style of one image to another. | Transform a photo into a painting style for print, create unique textures. |
| **Pattern Generators** | AI-driven tools that create seamless or repeating patterns. | Design custom fabric prints, digital papers for scrapbooking, wallpaper designs. |

## AI for Design Assistance

| Tool Type | Description | Craft Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Vectorization Tools** | Convert raster images (photos) into scalable vector graphics. | Turn hand-drawn sketches into SVG files for cutting machines (Cricut, Silhouette, laser cutters). |
| **Colour Palette Generators** | AI suggests harmonious colour schemes. | Find perfect colour combinations for knitting, painting, or jewelry design. |
| **Layout & Composition Assistants** | AI helps arrange elements for visual balance. | Optimize layouts for quilt blocks, scrapbook pages, or digital collages. |

## Ethical Considerations & Best Practices

| Consideration | Best Practice |
|---|---|
| **Originality** | Use AI as a tool for inspiration, not direct replication. Always add your unique creative touch. |
| **Copyright** | Be aware of the terms of service for AI tools regarding commercial use of generated images. |
| **Transparency** | If selling AI-assisted work, consider being transparent about the tools used. |
| **Skill Development** | Don't let AI replace learning fundamental craft skills; use it to enhance them. |
