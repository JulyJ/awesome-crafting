## Understanding File Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Best Practice | Common Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Resolution (DPI)** | Dots Per Inch. Determines print quality. | Aim for 150-300 DPI for fabric. Lower DPI results in pixelation. | Files too large (over 300 DPI) or too small (under 150 DPI) |
| **Colour Mode** | How colours are represented. | Use RGB for digital design, but be aware that printers use CMYK. Some services convert automatically. | Color shifts during printing, unexpected color results |
| **File Type** | The format your design is saved in. | JPEG, PNG, or TIFF for raster images. SVG for vector patterns (if applicable). | Compressed files losing quality, wrong format for service |
| **Repeat Type** | How your pattern tiles to create a seamless design. | Basic, half-drop, brick, or mirror repeats. | Visible seams, misaligned patterns |
| **File Size** | Storage space and upload limitations. | 25-100MB for most services. Balance quality with file size. | Upload failures, processing delays |
| **Bleed Area** | Extra design area beyond the cut line. | Add 1/8" bleed on all sides for professional results. | White edges, misaligned cuts |

## Technical Specifications by Fabric Type

| Fabric Type | Recommended DPI | Color Considerations | File Size Range | Best Applications |

| **Silk** | 200-300 DPI | Excellent color reproduction, subtle gradients | 50-100MB | Scarves, luxury items, fine art |
| **Polyester** | 150-200 DPI | Bright colors, synthetic feel | 25-50MB | Athletic wear, outdoor fabrics |
| **Linen** | 150-200 DPI | Muted colors, natural texture | 25-50MB | Home textiles, rustic designs |
| **Canvas** | 150-200 DPI | Bold colors, heavy-duty prints | 25-75MB | Bags, upholstery, art prints |
| **Lycra/Spandex** | 200-250 DPI | Stretchy substrate, color may shift | 40-80MB | Activewear, swimwear, fitted garments |
