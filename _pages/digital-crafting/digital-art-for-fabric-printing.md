## Understanding File Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Best Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Resolution (DPI)** | Dots Per Inch. Determines print quality. | Aim for 150-300 DPI for fabric. Lower DPI results in pixelation. |
| **Colour Mode** | How colours are represented. | Use RGB for digital design, but be aware that printers use CMYK. Some services convert automatically. |
| **File Type** | The format your design is saved in. | JPEG, PNG, or TIFF for raster images. SVG for vector patterns (if applicable). |
| **Repeat Type** | How your pattern tiles to create a seamless design. | Basic, half-drop, brick, or mirror repeats. |

## Designing Your Digital Fabric

| Design Software | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Adobe Photoshop** | Powerful raster editing, great for complex textures. | Subscription-based, steep learning curve. | Photo-realistic designs, intricate textures. |
| **Adobe Illustrator** | Vector-based, infinitely scalable. | Subscription-based, less intuitive for painting. | Geometric patterns, clean lines, logos. |
| **Procreate (iPad)** | Intuitive, great for hand-drawn feel. | Raster-based, limited vector capabilities. | Hand-drawn patterns, illustrative styles. |
| **Canva** | User-friendly, template-based. | Limited advanced features, less control over resolution. | Simple patterns, quick designs, beginners. |
