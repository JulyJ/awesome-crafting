### Design Principles for Laser Cutting

| Principle | Why It Matters | Measurement | Common Mistake |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Kerf Compensation** | Laser beam has width | Account for 0.1-0.3mm material removal | Tight-fit parts don't fit |
| **Minimum Detail Size** | Laser has limits | 0.5mm+ for cuts, 0.1mm+ for engraves | Tiny details don't cut through |
| **Bridge/Tab Placement** | Hold pieces during cutting | Every 4-6 inches for large pieces | Parts fall, shift during cutting |
| **Material Grain Direction** | Affects strength, warping | Orient grain for strength needs | Warped or weak final pieces |
| **Nesting Efficiency** | Maximize material use | <5% waste with good nesting | Expensive material waste |
| **Engraving DPI** | Balance quality and speed | 300-600 DPI for most projects | Too high = slow, too low = pixelated |

### File Preparation Workflow

| Step | Process | Tools | Time | Quality Check |
|------|---------|-------|------|---------------|
| **1. Design Creation** | Create artwork/design | Design software | 30min-8hrs | Proportions correct |
| **2. Vector Conversion** | Ensure all paths are vectors | Trace/redraw if needed | 10-60min | No raster images for cuts |
| **3. Color Coding** | Assign colors to operations | Layer/stroke colors | 5-15min | Cut=one color, engrave=another |
| **4. Size Verification** | Check real-world dimensions | Measure in software | 2-5min | Actual size intended |
| **5. Overlap Check** | Ensure no duplicate lines | Simplify/merge paths | 5-15min | No double-cutting |
| **6. Export** | Save in correct format | SVG, PDF, AI | 1-3min | Settings preserved |
| **7. Import to Laser Software** | Load into machine software | Machine-specific | 2-10min | Scaled correctly |
