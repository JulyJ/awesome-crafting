## Why Pricing Feels So Hard

Underpricing is the #1 mistake new makers make.  
It’s tempting to price low to compete, but that usually leads to burnout.

The goal is a **price that covers:**

- Your **material costs**
- Your **time**
- A **fair profit margin**
- Any **fees or overhead**

## The Maker Pricing Formula

Price = (Materials + Time x Hourly Rate) x Markup + Fees

| Element | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Materials** | All raw materials used | $5 vinyl, $3 blank, $2 packaging = $10 |
| **Time** | Time to make the item | 1.5 hrs @ $20/hr = $30 |
| **Markup** | Profit & business sustainability | (Materials + Time) × 1.5 |
| **Fees** | Etsy fees, transaction fees, taxes | ~10-15% estimate |

**Example Price:**  
`($10 + $30) × 1.5 = $60 → add 15% fees = $69`

## Hourly Rate Guide for Crafters

| Experience Level | Suggested Rate |
|------------------|----------------|
| Beginner | $15–$20/hr |
| Intermediate | $20–$35/hr |
| Skilled Artisan | $35–$50+/hr |

Start where you’re comfortable, but don’t forget:  
**Your skill is valuable.**

## Include These in “Overhead”

- Equipment (Cricut, printer, etc.)  
- Supplies that don’t go into the product (blades, glue, etc.)  
- Studio rent or utility share  
- Website/shop fees  
- Packaging & labels

## Tips for Better Pricing

- **Round up** to the nearest whole or appealing price point  
- Use **tiered pricing** for sets or bundles  
- Offer **limited editions** to test higher prices  
- Check **competitor pricing**, but don’t copy, compare quality too
