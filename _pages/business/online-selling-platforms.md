## Picking the Right Platform for Your Crafts

Your craft deserves a storefront that works for you.  
Let’s break down the most popular online options for handmade sellers.

---

## Comparison: Top Platforms

| Platform | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **Etsy** | Beginners, marketplace sales | Built-in traffic, easy to use | Fees add up, high competition |
| **Shopify** | Full control, growing brands | Custom branding, scalable | Monthly fee, setup takes time |
| **Squarespace** | Portfolio + shop | Beautiful designs, all-in-one | Less e-commerce focused |
| **Facebook/Instagram Shops** | Social sellers | Easy setup, integrated audience | Limited product tools |
| **Craft-specific platforms** | Niche reach | Passionate buyers | Smaller traffic |

## Etsy: Great for Starting

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Huge buyer base | You’re 1 of thousands |
| Easy listings | 6.5% transaction fee + listing + processing |
| Simple shipping setup | Can feel like “Etsy’s customer,” not yours |

## Shopify: Build Your Own Brand

- Full-featured e-commerce solution  
- Your domain, your rules  
- Add apps, blogs, email lists  
- Best for businesses ready to scale

> 💡 Consider using **Shopify Starter** for low-volume sellers ($5/month)

## Squarespace: For Visual Storytellers

- All-in-one portfolio + store  
- Beautiful templates  
- Limited back-end commerce features  
- Great for artists or one-of-a-kind sellers

---

## 📱 Social Shops: Fast & Free

- Great if you already have an audience  
- Facebook and IG now support full checkout  
- Best for impulse buys, smaller catalogs  
- Still need a fulfillment process in place

## Final Thought

Your platform should match:

- Your **volume**
- Your **brand goals**
- Your **comfort with tech**

Start where you are. Grow when you’re ready.  
You can always move platforms later.
